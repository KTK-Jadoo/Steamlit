3,1491170,这个游戏还是挺好玩的，npc有各自的故事和背景，互动了会慢慢了解他们，独立开发者前期需要从零开始（各种意义上）的艰难也表现得蛮好的，玩的时候是EA游戏，所以有一些bug什么的在所难免，期待完整版的游戏还有后续的DLC等,1,1613618390,442,0,9
4,1491180,"Not very different from the first game in the series - 'Lost Treasure'. Has some more crafting materials and more grind though. I liked it as much as the first game. The controls are ported over from the mobile version of the game so it pretty much feels like you are playing this game on the mobile. But as a fan of crafting and exploration RPGs, I don't really mind that.",1,1612534130,1411,0,106

6,1491180,"As its predeseccor, it is a nice simplistic adventure and survival game. It is a little bit more complex. I enjoyed it very much and hope for more in the future!",1,1621182874,830,0,42
13,1491200,"Few Nights More is a vampire Roguelike. You choose 1/4 vampire lords (you can unlock 3 more) and 1/3 attack styles, which change up the gameplay. In the game you build your castle, place traps and minions and decorations in the castle and try to maximize your resources and bonis in each step of the game.
It's unique roguelike gameplay which in this form I don't know from any other game, so it's an interesting game to test. Also it's one of a few games with a vampire setting, which makes it setting wise stand out.

The game is early access, has a fair amount of content and in terms of raw playtime worth the asking price.

I would recommend it, just based that it's well made, fun to explore and has some creativity to it.

The game is solid, however there are many drawbacks which I think hold it back from being a great game, and are not helping the experience.

I personally beat the game on run 4, in the first 3 runs I was mainly tasting each style of attack school and learning some peculiarities. I always died at night 13, as the second boss seems to be an insane spike in difficulty, balance wise.

From the 3 styles you can play, Necromancy is the most fun and the most powerful. THis boils down to 2 things: 1.) you can summn minions, of which one is baiting attacks from enemies and others have the chance to bait attacks, which increases your survivability tenfold. Secondly the skillset necromancy offers synergizes decay, summoning and upgrading minions in a perfect way. I think it's cool, but Blood and Ferocity suck.
The big thing why necromancy is so fun is that it also plays twice as quick as the two other styles, so I would rather say that those should be improved, instead of necromancy nerfed. 

It might ge tbetter with meta-progression with the other schools, however the metaprogression seems grindey, and you get points to invest, especially in the first round this is super confusing, as at this point you haven't even tried all options...

My final run took roughly 4 hours, which I think is snail pace and that's imo the games biggest drawback: how incredibly slow it is. You balance a lot of things and there is a ton of reading and math involved, so to play good it feels from the pace rather like a management / 4x game, then a round based tactics game.

In terms of the balancing, there are a lot of 2 and 3 percent bonuses, which all stack, so you can build yourself some ridiculous builds, which is cool. However there are a lot of character stats which are rather useless and you can't reroll, so you are bound to RNG. The static improvements ver the percent chances only help if you got skills which make use of those static numbers. The percentages, especially multicast in combination with block is incredibly powerful, totally breaking the game. 

Damagewise it feels like a spiral, enemies start with 25hp and and end up with 7000hp. WIth good use of percentage, I was able to crit the final boss with 3000 damage. It's ridiculous in the sense that some runs you are super slow, and others you go slow in order to carefully build out your bonuses, so you are again slow in the big scheme of things.

So yeah balance and the way how skills interplay, it' smore a game of avoiding the bad skills and perks and choosing the good ones or the least worst ones.

I don't know when other people tended to end their playthrough, but while I am experienced, run 4 seems super early and the progression seems otherwise grindy... so yeah it's a bit problematic.

In terms of the castle, you can use traps and minions. The only trap which really is useful is the beartrap, as the 5% of damage for big bosses, if you stack 3 of them together is a sizable chunk for the dangerous foes. Otherwise i didn#t see much point in using them, aside from health refilling flies, if i was below the curve.

The minions also don't do much (they are more helpful than the traps though), they only become useful when you got a lot and you get the terrorbonus, when they increase your power. But since the power bonus is a static one, even the 20 points this adds doesn't do much in the late game.

Trinkets are cool and so are Decorations, both of them provide useful additions and bonuses.

Beginning perks (the ones in the choicebox of a new run) seem to mostly make the game harder, so they are not desirable. I never felt to go with any one of these in any run, as it seemed always like a bad idea.

Rooms are cool with their sizes and bonuses, although sometimes it'd be cool to place smaller rooms in bigger slots.

Prestige bonuses, especially the ones which say they reward you with a room are easy to confue. As I understood ""2 terror/pleasure rooms"" as exactly that type of room, not one of the sets of rooms and this did cost me points in my strategy, it's an easy thing to fix though.

I think it's a massive problem that mastery and skill-upgrade bonuses based on rng are super bad. You always should go for mastery if it pops up, as it opens your possibility space. WIth the skills it's frustrating that there is no way to upgrade the ones you have... it's hard ot get a skill you need and there is also no list of all skills you could look up, so I was making my builds up as i went along... but I have after 4 runs no idea how many skills there really are.

----
I couldn't find any crashes but there are multiple bugs I found:
Bugs:

-Currently there is a music bug, that after act 2 the music stops playing completely

-There is a bug with the vampire fang trinket, with the string of the description, this I also saw for other trinkets providing the same bonus.

-There is a bug, with reputation / prestige point objects, some objects (like the glas slamps) work fine, others, especially for ""prestige"" seem broken, as they don#t add any points - I can't confirm it 100% correctl,y, but either they don't stack or just don't work.

-There is a typo where ""incresed"" instead of ""increased"" is written in one of the tooltips of the upgrading menu at the end of the run

-There are memory leaks, after 3 hours the game significantly slows down

---

The UI sadly is a mess.

It starts with opening a room to see what's inside in terms of decor, traps and minions, why is that not just always displayed in the room and in a tooltip i need to open and then in the middle of the screen (and in that tooltip i also can't pull any decors or minions, so i need to close it again, remember the room, the stuff which is in and then set it there)

Sometimes tooltips don't close correctly and then fly around in the game, until you open the menu or another tooltip.

In the merchant window, you can't sell equipped decors. 
You don#t see which trinkets are equipped, more than once i sold trinkets which I had equipped... this was frustrating

Presentation:

You definitely don't play the game for the artstyle, the art is mostly basic. Cool animations are missing. The sound design is super basic and all the loading screens etc. look more like student work than professional art, but it has some charm to it.
Readability overall is bad, there is a lot of contrast in the wrong spots, causing unnecessary eyestrain and headache afte rlonger sessions.

---

So there is a lot of negative stuff I pointed out, which however doesn't really get in the way of a solid experience, The game is not great and not perfect, but it's engaging. With work in the right spots it could become good. I just think that in the current state people either drop out immediately or will play through it, the steam numbers seem to solidify this.
If you get anything from that type of game, you should check it out regardless, as it's interesting, unusual and good fun for a few hours.",1,1712767760,887,0,22
14,1491280,"I almost missed this gem of a game. I enjoyed this game and played for 6 hours taking my time. The Story... Jane Angel contacted her sister Nancy begging for help but when Nancy arrives at Jane's house she is met by a stranger in a mask. The stranger throws a book at her and suddenly they are both on a ship in the 1500th cebtury. I think, after the player past freeing hisself from the ship they will see the adventure really takes off. Voice overs and characters you meet in the game are good. There were no glitches I encountered. The HO scenes are clear not to dark and fun to play. The graphics were very good along of various locations and I found the story to be interesting. So two thumbs up, for this adventure.",1,1614802807,254,0,122

16,1491280,"This is in many ways superior to the first [I]Jane Angel[/I] game: it's a real point-and-click adventure this time, with a lot of interesting locations and puzzles.

But, OMG. The writing. The voice acting. It seems that no lessons were learned from the first [I]Jane Angel[/I] game. The English translation is so bad it verges on the ridiculous. But even if it were competent, the story itself is like a B-movie written by drunken toddlers who got bored in the middle and took a nap break. THE END.

Gameplay is fine. The rest is ... so bad that it's good? Kinda. If you play this genre of games you already have low standards for storytelling. But this one takes the cake.

It's also very short.",0,1665305755,242,0,588
17,1491340,"Developers, please add VR support! Standing in the room seeing our creations in VR would push this casual game over the top!",1,1722383866,741,0,24
18,1491390,"Unfortunately, I just can't recommend the game. The plot is incredibly lazy. You get what's happened maybe 30 minutes in, and the next 4 hours or so you just gather clues to prove your theory. I was hoping for some twist, but it never happened. So, basically, it fails miserably as a detective story. Still, many crime stories just pretend to be detectives to tell us psychological stories about broken families, mental health issues and so on. Is this one of these stories? Nope, not at all. The characters are one-dimensional, and no, they won't get any further development in emails and text messages, Sharp Objects or Gone Girl it is not. 

I was lucky enough to play through the whole game without any glitches, so no complains here. The visuals are pleasing enough, but I just don't get it, the interiors are a bit retro even by the 2020's standards, laptops are from our time, how is this futuristic?

Gameplay is pretty solid - that is, if you don't mind pure exploration games. Sure, there are some light puzzles, but I doubt you'll ever get stuck; still, personally, I don't mind this approach at all, it's calm and relaxing. I'd be quite pleased with the game were it not so shallow and predictable.",0,1701455834,295,0,21
19,1491390,"Forest Grove is not a great game, I don't even think it's a good game. I was so disappointed as I was very much looking forward to playing it. The concept itself has SO much potential and a lot of puzzles in the game were interest albeit a tad simplistic. The major flaw is it's predicable story and the technical issues of which there are many. There was so much here that could have been built on and fleshed out but it feels rushed and incomplete. I am looking forward to seeing what the developer does in the future as basic concept is so very interesting but perhaps needs better writing and more care into fixing bugs.",0,1705806117,452,0,39
20,1491390,"This game uses detective mechanics so that we can solve the mystery of a missing teen named Zoey. There are several people of interest and we gotta figure out who could be responsible. We play as a detective that uses future tech to simulate locations in order to solve crimes. I appreciate that it has voice acting and it's not bad. The controls are fine and the environment is decent as well. The mystery is intriguing enough to warrant the price tag.

21,1491400,"I found this game to be pretty lame when compared to PowerBeats VR. Unlike PowerBeats, there is no rhythm or pattern that the boxes come at you. I found this discouraged me from actually punching. It was easier just to stand there and hold out the controllers to match the path of the boxes. So there is really no need to actually ""punch"" in this game. The boxes also fly at you in groups at alternating speeds to the point where you can't possibly touch all of them. So just hold out your hands and move them around, which of course is pretty boring. The graphics are also low-res and you can't select the environment you play in. I would MUCH rather play PowerBeats VR than this game any day.",0,1659239951,28,0,457

28,1491460,"After 30 hours I am still having fun.  There is a bit of a lack of dungeon variety at this moment. 
 However, the dev is pumping out the patches like crazy and more content is coming. 
 The game can be played solo or with a group.  Group is definitely more fun though, joining the discord for some tough missions with voice chat is a blast.

Pros:
1. [b]Interesting item effects -[/b] Interesting items with lots of unique and interesting abilities, this is definitely the strong point of the game.
2. [b]Build crafting -[/b] Build crafting by combining unique effects from gear and talents is a lot of fun.  I have seen quite a few interesting builds people have created.
3. [b]Free respecs -[/b] Respec in town for free between missions allowing you to quickly change build as you get new gear and talents.
4. [b]Boss effects can be crazy but fun -[/b] Fun with large groups of people, 10 person game boss mechanics are definitely more chaotic as boss effects scale, but also way more fun.
5. [b]Solo and multiplayer fun -[/b] Fun for both solo and with a group (some classes like priestess are group focused though, so this is not true for all classes, although you never know with the builds people come up with)

Cons:
1. [b]Dungeon content variety -[/b] The dungeon exploration portion before the boss could use more mini events, normal mobs, elite mobs, etc.  Currently it feels like it is best to ignore it and find the boss as fast as possible.
2. [b]Some crazy boss effect combos -[/b] Some boss effect combinations are crazy, however you can reroll map effects and the dev has toned down some of the really unfun ones in the last few days already.",1,1657949651,3920,0,19
29,1491460,"I got to say, i can see that there could be a lot of different ways they could improve this game in the future but, for now im saying not fun enough to play.

I do have to say that i played on my own but, i dont think the multiplayer is going to save the game for now.

Gameplay loop seems way too simple to be honest, run in a maze like place till you find the boss room > activate boss fight > spam normal attack till you have enough resources to use abilities till the boss is dead > gain loot to sell/use > put some points in to passive skill tree system(nothing special to see there) > repeat the loop till its too boring to continue.

30,1491460,"With only less than 2 hours of game play, I am hooked! This game reminds of of Vampire Survivors but with online co-op (up to 10 people). Controls are easy to pick up and plenty of ways to customize your character. Overall, it's definitely worth your time, especially if you have others that could join you online. 

Pros: 
-Wide range of characters to choose from
-Menus are simple and user friendly
-Skill tree has plenty of selection without being too much
-Each level is different
-Boss battles are really fun and uses up the whole map

Room for improvements:
-(For Summoner) no cursor seen when directing summoned creatures to enemy/boss units
-No way to disable/skip the pop up dialogues at the lower early levels 
-If you want to level up Priestess, you definitely need a couple of people with you for DPS
-When waiting for the group to ready up, there should be an indicator of what the unready players are doing (showing which menu/page they're on

31,1491460,"This game has potential but the DEVELOPERS HAVE GIVEN UP WORKING ON THIS GAME, so its just going to sit in limbo forever unless some person somewhere changes their mind, if it had continuing development, i would say buy it, but it does not, so don't. try out duelyst (free) or vampire survivors (cheap) instead, in this price-range.",0,1675625670,99,0,43
32,1491460,"I've played one one-hour session together with one friend. If I remember I will update my review after getting more playtime in and after trying out higher party sizes.

Even just the two of us we had a great time and are interested to play more and get more of our friends on board.

As an MMORPG veteran in soft-retirement the concept absolutely speaks to me. Hat's off to the developer for executing on an idea that I and I'm sure plenty of other MMO players have had in the back of their minds, that idea being to condense the ""game"" of MMORPG raiding down into a standalone experience, stripped of the level grind, gearing up, gold/item farming, and weekly lockout timers that increase the time-commitment of being an MMO Raider.

Honestly my dream game would be if this game eventually gets a fully-3D 2.0 like Risk of Rain did, moving it mechanically closer to the experience of raiding in WoW-style MMORPGs, while maintaining the quick replayability and low barriers to entry. I hope this game is a financial success for the developer and leads to even bigger and better things down the line.

One word of caution to any readers on the fence: This game has not had it's big break yet and so the community and playerbase is small. If you and 1-9 friends all coordinate to get the game together you'll immediately start having a great time, but if you're coming in solo you'll need to join the discord and coordinate with strangers to get groups together, as the in-game matchmaking doesn't have a large pool to pull from for you.

The game can be played solo but I can't speak to that experience yet.",1,1671044030,816,0,7

Developer is active almost every day and even joining the session without any benefits, Thumbs up for the Developer!

If you are looking for multiplayer experience, i'll advise you to hold on, until the developer find a way to fix the multiplayer lobby experience. When you reach floor 30-40, you get stucked, due to very low population, most of the time it take 15 mins to find a party. There is a official discord community, it get quite toxic sometimes, if you don't join the voice chat or share your screen, you get accused of hacking or kick out of the party.

Floor 1 to 20 is a breeze and able to solo with any class, after floor 30, you need a small group, after 40 you need a experience group. those able to go floor 100 is due to early rogue skill exploits.

Tutorial boxes that won't go away until reboot that hide the controls in-game certainly didn't help either. Nor did a lack of 1440p support (there's support for 1080p, 4k, and several weird ratios that are less wide than standard 16:9).",0,1666493456,29,0,68

There's a surprising amount of depth here that may not show at first glance. 

This game showcases a perfect mix, I think, of both levels that will test your wits and problem-solving and levels that require that perfect timing and fluid platforming movements.

What's worse, is that the ""hit"" boxes for where you need to click and drag things to are beyond awful.  You need to be -ridiculously- precise in dropping the items where the game wants you to.  Right off the bat, you need to use the cane on the pine tree with the chipmunk in it, and after clicking it onto 5 different places on the branch, the hint told me I needed to put it in one, painfully specific place.

90,1490790,"I bought this for Christmas, expecting the same cozy holiday feeling that I got from Christmas Adventure: Candy Storm. Boy, was I wrong. This game feels like it was made by completely different people.

The first thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the terrible English, it really made me want to do just about anything else other than keep playing this game. On top of that, the puzzles weren't very intuitive and ended up being frustrating at times. In particular, it greatly annoyed me when the ""instruction"" window (that normally describes which items one is supposed to find next to progress the Hidden Object scene) would get bugged and stop showing any text. This resulted in me having to just blindly guess my way through the rest of that scene, an annoyance that was only further exacerbated by the game's anti-spam-clicking mechanism - a 'feature' which causes the whole screen to get frozen in ice for several seconds if one clicks something other than the correct item within a short time. Needless to say, this ended up with me sitting there twiddling my thumbs more than a few times, while regretting my choice of buying this game. As for the story, I found it a bit strange and hard to follow - though after reading some of these reviews from others who actually finished the game, I'm just as glad that I never got to finish it myself.

Overall, I couldn't handle more than two hours of gameplay before I had to close the game and go do something else. I decided to give it another shot a few days later, and found that my progress hadn't even been saved, so I would have to start all over again from the beginning - something I was unwilling to do. I can only assume that this was another bug, unless I had missed a ""Save Game"" option (which I had specifically looked for before quitting, to no avail), but either way, this was enough to completely deter me from this game that had already disappointed me.

In hindsight, I really should've looked at the reviews like I tend to do before buying games, but I'll admit I excitedly bought this one without investigating it properly due to how much I liked the previous game. This one would have for sure been a refund, if only I had spent a little less time struggling with it and trying to extract some form of holiday cheer from the experience.

94,1490790,"I really enjoyed playing Christmas Adventure: Candy Storm from the same publisher, even replayed it a few times, so I was looking forward to playing Christmas Adventures: A Winter Night's Dream. Unfortunately, compared with Candy Storm, A winter Night's Dream was a big disappointment. 

Firstly, story is kinda weird, or better said unclear when you play the game. There is no clear narative what you have to achieve overall. It's more a collection of separate tasks that don't have any connection between them. Looking back after going through the game, it became clear that you have to replace certain ""pagan"" objects with christian christmas objects but the position of those is scattered all around the game and not really making sense. I would feel much better if they were all in the same space like they usually are in homes and it would be clear from the start that this is what you have to do (find all and put them there). 

Secondly, the hidden object scenes take too long. All hidden object screens have two parts. In the first part  you are given a kind of riddle, which you sole by finding and combining two or three objects from the scene. The second part is the ""usual"" hidden object puzzle where you have to find a list of items on screen. The first part is unnecessarily long and doesn't add much (if any at all) value. After finding all items for the riddle (some riddles are really strange), you have to click on those items again for the combination scene to start and play out. Too slow, too long, boring. 

Lastly, there is no spoken dialogs (in english, don't know if there are other lanugages) which made the game feel empty. I would prefer even poorly recorded dialogs over silence. Some dialogs disappear too quickly to read and some instructions are quite unclear. You have to be very patient and careful when placing the items on the scenes. Some scenes have a very specific area where the item will work. If you think that you have a correct item but it doesn't work the first time try clicking on different spots.

96,1490790,"This game is somewhat simplistic in the hidden object genre of games.  It might be entertaining for young audiences, but for seasoned gamers, it may lack the challenge and the extras (like mini game challenges) that make the hidden object game more enticing to play.  So for my personal playing choice, this game was a bit sub par, but still might be enjoyable to play if it were not for the following issue.

The biggest negative is that it fails to save your game progress.  Each time I have had to quit mid-game, when I start the game again, it begins back at the very beginning.  I believe this is a bug and they may fix it in a future release.  The hint to my last comment is that they do provide for multiple profiles to be saved.  Yet it fails to save game progress.  Due to this action, I can't give it a positive recommendation.

UPDATE:  After doing some troubleshooting, I now have the game saving my progress.  I uninstalled the game, shut down Steam, reboot my computer, restarted Steam, and then performed the install again on this game.    I have now played the game more and have performed 6 game exits as a test.  Each time I re-started the game back up, it took me to where I left off.  Much better.  

Another reviewer mentioned the same problem with saving game process, so I still believe there is a bug in the program that may be difficult for the developers to replicate so that they can apply a fix.  I may have just been lucky with my fix.

Because of this update, I can now change my recommendation to a positive one.  

UPDATE #2:  Unfortunately, after 4 hours of play time within this game, it appears (in my opinion) to have more problems.  I am at a point in the game where I can't advance.  All attempts have failed to advance play.  In all accessible locations, even the hint option indicates there is nothing to do.  Only one item is in the inventory cart and even after resorting to a walk through reference, attempting to place the one inventory item where it is supposed to go does not work.  Going through every step in the walk through to verify nothing had been previously missed did not help.  The next steps to move forward in the walk through can not be completed either.  The game appears to be stuck waiting for something to be completed that has probably already been accomplished.  Since there is no way to back up, the game hint function nor the walk through does not indicate a problem or what may be missing, I can't finish the game (without completely restarting).  This forces me to reverse my recommendation to a negative review.",0,1608851099,252,0,3

There are a couple of translation errors that will leave you randomly clicking until you find what it is you're looking for (like a lobster, named Omar); however the first game in the Christmas Adventure series has similar translation errors so I went in expecting it.

In the best of times, I loved this game for what it was. The art is beautiful, the the concept is charming, the music is delicately blissful, and it is a fun thing to play to pass the time while enjoying a nice winter night. At the worst of times, I was simply able to brush off the nonsense mechanics that occasionally popped up as simple elements to move the story forward and get you the items you needed to fill the time. All in all, this was supposed to be a fun and relaxing game that, while at times a little illogical and goofy, wouldn't cause unbridled rage and resentment for the capability of humans to vomit up the most sinful of false entertainment. Everything was going great until I got to the volcano rune drawing part (if that sounds absurd, it's because it is and deserves to be mocked like pig garbage slap trash that it is) which proved to be the feature that turned this game from a nice Christmas adventure to a hellish nightmare like that of my reoccurring night terrors. Suffocating from the merciless downfall of thick black ash only to be overtaken by the destructive fire of Earth's magma in my dying breath would be more enjoyable than this game. I'd rather scissor kick a bear and challenge it's superior strength than play this game. I'd rather Santa show up at my house in the middle of July when I'm sleep in bed sweating from the Summer heat and throat punch my unsuspecting neck for ever buying this game. Don't let yourself enjoy this game just to have that happiness ripped from your innocent little hands, your cute little innocent gamer hands. This game is worse than swallowing water the wrong way and you start to cough when there are other people around and they all start asking you if you're okay and you try to stop coughing and just wish they'd stop looking at you and your face is getting all red but you just have to say your okay when you're not. I hate this game so much that I don't even want to get a refund because the money I used to spend it feels doomed to only purchase me gross little piles of gutter trash thrown away in a dumpster fire. Laughing at inappropriate times because someone made you laugh and just the idea of having to stop laughing in that moment but not being able to, thus causing you to laugh more and making everyone look at you and think ""what the heck is wrong with that person why are they laughing right now they're awful"" sounds like a better time than playing this game. Now, one might ask, ""Stranger leaving this review, did you finish the game after you got past the volcano rune drawing puzzle?"" and as a response, I would say, ""Yes, I did finish the game, but only because I'm prideful and refused to let this game win."" Now, is that to say that I didn't use the SKIP button to get past the volcano rune drawing puzzle? No, it's not to say that, because that's exactly what I did. And maybe haters will say that by doing that, the game did win. And to that I say that you're entitled to your stupid and wrong and thoughtless opinion but you're wrong and dumb like this game.

The core of the frustration comes at first with the game's sense of logic, which from the get-go is just god awful, but quickly turns to the inconsistency in controls. the preciseness to which you are expected to click varies wildly, to the point where I have used hints to tell me where it wants AND THE CLICK HAS STILL NOT REGISTERED EVEN IN THE CENTRE OF THE CIRCLE, as do whether or not you're expected to click two objects together or manipulate the mouse to make it look as though they're together.    
The game will tell you to find certain objects only to find there are multiple in the picture but only one correct. ropes, bootstraps, and bows all fell to this. /there will be little ""crafting""sections before each hidden object scene and I dread them greatly. sometimes an animation will start, sometimes not. sometimes you have to click at the end and sometimes it APPARENTLY wants you to take the god damned eyes out of a crow figure, after never prompting you for such an item or giving you the ability to do similar the whole game. 
The inconsistency continue with picking up items and getting prompted to do things that you've not only not come across, but not even unlocked the area for, multiple times. 

The point I knew I'd be asking for a refund was when the crafting part of the game asked me to ""tie the necktie"", proceeded to only let me click the boot and ice cube, and had me smash the cube to get a key, All with me barely registering that the instructions were incorrect because fucking why would they be in this pile of shit?

The leaps of logic in the puzzles, along with the tiny hit boxes on objects makes for a very frustrating game.

119,1490790,"This is simply one of the worst HOGs and worst designed games I have ever played.

Each hidden object puzzle begins with a series of required items you must find before getting to the main HOG, which is frustrating by itself, but the descriptions are vague, badly translated, or plain misleading and wrong.  The complete leaps of logic and random guessing would almost be tolerable if there was not a misclick penalty that does not cool down no matter how long you wait.

The scenes are not connected sensibly in any way, with multiple zones selectable near the beginning of the game that you do not getting the required item until near the end.  With no map, there is no way to make any sense of what you are supposed to do next.  Despite hundreds of hours of HOG experience, I have never clicked the hint button so many times - and I usually avoid all hints.

I appreciate a game that makes you think, not a game that forces you to click randomly until you stumble upon the solution.

The only thing that kept me going to the end was a desire to see how bad it got, and spite because I already bought this piece of garbage. Don't waste your money or your time. 

PS: only reason my play time was so long was because I left it running when I went to go do other stuff, playtime was around 2 hours to fully complete and wouldn't even take that long if the clues actually made sense.

The ""gameplay"" involves switching between different still cameras in rooms while actors do a 15 min scene where a murder happens at the end. You have a 360 VR view in each room, but you can't move from the spot the camera places you in. The VR looks ok, I guess. I don't really feel like I'm standing in a room because the camera was placed a bit too low and the actors and walls and such kind of lord over you. You can rewind and fast forward the scene at will. The scene contains the answers to three questions that are asked of you at the beginning of the game, with the third question being ""Who is the murderer?"" You don't have to watch the whole thing play out in each room to find the answers to the questions. For each room, the game highlights the sections of the playback bar where any action is taking place, so you can just skip around to those parts. Another problem I have with the game is the conclusion. 


*spoilers*


At the end of the game, the murderer is identified and arrested. But who actually solved this case and how? I'm the one collecting the clues and making the conclusions, but I'm an invisible, omniscient observer who's not actually in the scene. To my understanding of the plot, there isn't really much linking the murderer to the actual event and another character has as much of a hand setting up the accident that kills the victim as much as the ""real"" murderer.",0,1610061835,25,0,8
128,1490850,"This game is basically a movie of around 15 mins, but as it occurs in different rooms, you need to rewind the video so you can see what occurred in each room during that time. Although even doing this it only takes less than an hour to see what happened in each room because several of the rooms will be empty at a time. Once you've watched it you can try to answer the three questions and see if you're right, which shows a final video.

You can easily switch between the rooms by clicking them from the map. This places you in the centre of the room and you cannot move around or interact, only watch the 360 degree video of what happened there. If you can't speak Chinese it seems to have decent English subtitles.

I think the main issues with this game are that a) it is far too short and b) there's no real reason to replay it once you've completed it. If you can perhaps get it on sale I'd say it's worth a try.",1,1610184762,59,0,1

You [i]could[/i] hurry through the game and skim all the scenes to get the information you need in order to answer the 3 questions and ""finish"" the game, but that's not really the best way to experience the content.

I recommend you stream to a friend or two on Discord and and enjoy it like a murder mystery, digging into the motives of the characters, and watching their body language for interesting clues on their relationships. 

Most folks seem to spend around an hour on this, I spent around two, but buying it while it's on sale is a good idea - it's probably worth around $5 - about as much as movie.

134,1490870,"I enjoyed my time with Pale Night. The controls felt great. The added spice on the platformer genre in the form of the light mechanics were interesting. In terms of difficulty, I'd say it is generally accessible though it has some challenging parts in the main path. The art, while minimalistic, does have some charm. Reaching the end credits can be done pretty fast, but the game offers collectibles to fetch, hidden or harder to reach, which adds a challenge and therefore can help spending more time. Given the game nature, it also presents some speedrunning value if one is interested.
The games works fine on steam deck with proton, though one should note it does not implement cloud saves at the time of writing.

There are a lot of great game design ideas and rather than using the same mechanics, again and again, Pale Night prefers to surprise players and re-invent new mechanics they will have to master.

For example, level 35 would have acted as a great tutorial for the green tile, but the green tile had been introduced quite earlier. Levels like 13 and 60 presented massive difficulty spikes that were honestly refreshing, but the levels following seemed trivial in comparison. While the core gameplay is great, the difficulty curve could use a bit of work.

I would also love to see a bit more feedback on the loss of a level, maybe something that makes it a bit easier to see at a glance which tile you ended up losing because of. 

For quality of life: a quick restart key, wasd support, and a ""back to main menu"" button after the last level would be appreciated

This game does it well. There are a few bit that I find annoying with some of the horror, but he I'm only on chapter 3. I'll update this when I complete the game and give my final take on it but for now here is how I feel about the game. 
[h1] The Review [/h1]
You get a letter in the mail inviting you to take part in a escape room like event in a apartment, when you arrive you grab your key and begin the game and no matter how this looks. Its a multiplayer game, but you don't play with other people in the same space. Instead you talk to other players through this games social platform call ""Propaganda"" on a computer that is next to a mirror. This mirror is where the multiplayer part of the game kicks in, you see everyone has their own ""world"" with their own items but there are some puzzles that require one or more pieces of the puzzle. With the mirror you can Import and upload files to Propaganda to help other players.
I can here you asking ""ok so thats the escape room multiplayer aspect of the game, what about the horror?"" well this game isn't called ""mirror layers"" for nothing as most of the game you will be traveling between your world and the mirror world. There you will encounter one of the many monsters in the game that I called the ""opposite"", which when it walks around its sounds like a bag of broken glass is being stepped on, not to mention how it makes weird noises every so often. I don't want to spoil any more and yes I just teased you with what is the interesting part of the game, so you can buy it and try it yourself piecing the story of this scary fever dream. I hope you got something from this ""review"" and have a good day.",1,1635632696,679,0,15
161,1490980,"This game does more with the horror genre than just the standard ""run/hide from the monster while solving mundane puzzles and piecing together a run-of-the-mill edgy backstory"", and I really appreciate that about it.

I really enjoyed this game a lot, and it was definitely worth the $20. However, it's not flawless, so I'll go over the pros and cons (focusing more on the pros to better paint the experience I had with this game).

PROS:
-  Most of the puzzles leave you feeling satisfied. There are a few outliers (and I'll go over those in the CONS section), but the vast majority of them get you thinking about them for a while, before fragmented pieces of information randomly piece together in your head, and you feel this appreciation for the ingenuity of the puzzle-design. Most of the times, all the hints are laid there before you, and there aren't any red-herrings either. Unlike many riddle-based games, you don't look back on the puzzle feeling cheated. Enigma 2 was a masterpiece in my opinion, and I've seen many other players share the same sentiment. As I've said though, there are some outliers.
- The atmosphere and the general horror elements were decent for the most part. The aesthetics of the mirror world, which seem to be inspired by the Upside Down from Stranger Things, made me feel incredibly uneasy every time I crossed into it from the comfort of the real world apartment. The main monster was pretty standard - you either have to run or hide from him, and he doesn't run as fast as you, so evading him is pretty easy. However, I like how the game at least gives you some agency - by giving you the choice to shorten the monster's stay as long as you're aware it's riskier. Makes his random spawns a lot less impeding to your progress.
- I have to talk about the design and model-work of everything, as they are very well-made. You may think it's strange that I even bring this up, but indie games with highly detailed model-work are a rare sight, so it's easily a +1 for this game. It just goes to show just how polished and well-realized this game is. The devs did put a lot of attention to detail in this game, and this worth every appreciation. That being said, there are a few outliers, which are in the CONS section.
- The story(ies) were really well-presented. As of right now, I don't have a complete grasp of it, but I liked the way it was subtly hinted at throughout the game in fragmented pieces. It isn't easy to piece together, but it's also not as unnecessarily obscure and difficult to comprehend as FNaF. Without spoiling much, you are invited to Chandran Apartments by an unknown entity to investigate the tragedies that occurred within its walls throughout the years. There are 5 separate stories you'll eventually piece together, as well as some extra lore involving extra-dimensional beings and the mysterious inner-workings of the mirror world.
EDIT: I now understand more of the story, and let me just say that once it sinks in, you'll realize just how brilliant it is! It did take me at least two playthroughs however to fully absorb some of the more subtle details. Regardless, it's one of those rare horror game stories that has you pondering about its message for hours, and you'll most likely reflect on some of your questionable actions in this game.
- By far the best aspect of this game is Propaganda, the social media platform built into it. You get to (asynchronously) interact with other players for key information or missing puzzle pieces. What I appreciate the most about it is how it's an ingenious balancing mechanic (intentionally or unintentionally). For puzzles that were difficult but not overly obscure, you will likely not browse the social media for the solutions (and if I'm not mistaken, a lot of the solutions are either hidden behind a spoiler tag, or heavily moderated/removed). But for the more obscure puzzles that you know you would never have guessed, there will be tons of posts on the social media asking for hints or partial answers, so the game neatly balances itself out on puzzles that may seem a little unfair. My point is - normally if you're stuck in a part, you'd look up the solution online, right? But since the internet is built into the game, maybe looking up the solutions for the unfair puzzles is literally part of the game? Idk, if you ask me, it's a pretty ingenious solution to potential shortcomings in puzzle-design (which there sparingly are, unfortunately).

CONS:
- Unfortunately, the game has cons, and most of them are back-loaded. One of them being what I mentioned above - unfair puzzles. There wasn't a single quote-on-quote ""unfair"" puzzle that left you feeling cheated... until Enigma 5. That layer had 4 puzzles, and 2 of them make you feel like you would never have guessed them ever. Like, there are almost no affordances or room for intuitive-thinking in those 2 puzzles, and they'll leave you feeling more frustrated. Thankfully though, there's the social media built into the game, so I never really had to look up a tutorial outside of the game.
- There were some inconsistent graphics/ aesthetic choices, though these are just minor cons. The model work for the third layer's monster seemed kinda low-poly and texture-less, and the insides of rooms in distant buildings also looked bland. These are the only 2 cases I can think of though.
- The lack of save-state was annoying a lot of the times. Especially when some of the items couldn't be stored on the computer, and you had to grab them from the far corner of an apartment every time you exited out of the game. I also wanted to replay some of the key moments from the game to see how differently they play out, but there was no way to save. Additionally, the inability to start a new game is perplexing, especially since the game is clearly rich in easy-to-miss story details and has a lot of replay-value.
- Some mechanics that were coded into the game but never used? Again, only a minor con, but for instance, peeping through the peep hole or ringing the doorbell of the other apartments were never really utilized, although tbf they didn't need to be.

169,1490980,"Have not yet finished, but I think I am near the end, and this is once again one of my favorite horror games ever. One of the creators, Ivan Zanotti, is definitely in my top three horror game devs. Revolabs, who created the original Mirror Layers and also developed this one, is clearly no slouch either. Really great puzzles, I love the social media implementation and how it helps without ruining the experience, and there are also a number of surprise ghosts that were not in the original game, each of which has been totally terrifying. This game really feels like a product of the best work of both developers. It took a pretty long time to finally come out, but boy, was it worth it.

171,1490980,"""The hunt begins.""

First let me start off by saying that is game is unique. Very unique. Unique in the fact that it combines these asinine concepts. I don't recommend this game for the pure reason it has a good idea. The execution is also great. .

Pros:
-A long playtime, ranging from 10-15 hours.
-Good atmosphere, well execution in a narrow space and working the environment to its' fullest.
-The graphics are good, even though sometimes things look better than each other.
-A very unique system which in turn asks you to give a part of yourself.
-Good and different puzzles. The game doesn't feel dragged out.
-Movement feels good when compared to IMSCARED. (A game made by MyMadnessWorks, another game I'd recommend.)

Cons:
-Lack of directions for some parts. (Especially at the beginning you can get lost easily and waste some 15-20 minutes.)
-The unique system I mentioned also takes off the tension as you can just see the solution of a puzzle easily but that can be avoided with some self caution.
-The start can be somewhat slow.
-A slight lack of polish towards end of the game. (This is something I cannot directly point to.)

End:
-All in all, it is a great game and is worth the price tag.",1,1635802550,875,0,7

174,1490980,"I don't know if i will ever finish it, because i already had some heart attacks from the jumpscares and very scary atmosphere.

But let me say this: the premise and execution of this game is fantastic. You explore an apartment, in two worlds, exchange in an asynchronous co-op experience in a social network clues (and yes, you have to use it, some things are just not in your world) and are always on edge on while solving the next mystery. The sound and visual design matches everything perfectly and i think it has just the right mix of realism and surrealism.

Oh, and you can freely scribble on a notebook in game, which really gives another level of immersion.

Don't worry about other players spoiling something for you: you have an ""enigma"" level, which goes up with your progress and you will not see posts from players that are above a certain threshold, so the game always will feel like a community effort.

Altough i would probably enjoy this game more without the horror, but this is just my subjective view.

Anyways, even if i might not finish it: great game, and i love to support the developers!",1,1697154647,157,0,24
175,1490980,"A very atmospheric and great horror experience. Its at its core (in my opinion) a puzzle game so don't go into this looking for an Outlast linear experience, there are similar qualities like when you run and hide from the Mirror Entity, but its much more in-depth mechanically as their are a lot of factors that allow you to escape and pinpoint the entity's exact location. As you progress you will go through various stories and events that are represented by different Enigmas. These shift the game into its own separate encounter in order to spice up the variety in the game (they are my favorite parts of the game especially enigma 2). There are a decent amount of these and they are all in their own way memorable and unique. The base game aside from the enigmas can get a little monotonous and slow at times as some of the puzzles are extremely slow placed in how you solve them, but once you do it always feels like an accomplishment in the vein of a puzzle in Myst or another Adventure Game. The story is creative and again really interesting in how it changes up each enigma like in the game VISAGE. 

Another huge aspect of this game that works wonderfully is the social media implementation called Propaganda. This is such a unique and cool part of the game, as it can help players that are stuck, while also allowing you to piece the puzzle together yourself without spoiling the answers. I love this system and am surprised this is the first time I have seen a mechanic like this in a puzzle game, and an indie game no less. The system allows you to send a large amount of things to other players. A camera (that you get as you progress) allows you to take a picture of anything in the game world and you can send over any of those pictures onto Propaganda. This really helps smoothe out puzzles that require visuals as you can take a picture of all the things you need and take that with you for reference, and have the ability to post that reference to Propaganda so people can help you with it in real time.

Overall, Mirror Layers is an incredibly impressive outing from Revolab and MyMadnessWorks. Considering this game was a demo that already felt complete like 4 years ago, its really awesome that it was finally finished and has displayed an experience I would say is comparable to some of the best indie horror games out there. The social aspect is very engaging and makes simply talking to someone on it feel fun like you are browsing a forum about a huge mystery that you all are trying to solve it just feels very cozy and cooperative.

Its a pretty big nuisance, and can stay out in the field from a few seconds to a good few minutes. Its also worth noting that he can sometimes just .. find you, for no reason .. However you can tell when he's onto your location by the music and his walking pace! It may seem counter intuitive, but you are faster than Tink Tink, if it is on to your location, leave asap, even if its super close by. Taking a hit is better than a insta dead! I also had some instances where a core attached to the back of a body coming out of the wall, would just .. stop Tink Tink from coming out? Not sure about that and would like to test if true.

The demo seemed like a puzzle game with some horror elements. the full game has just been looking for a puzzle to solve and dying to the same monster, that may change later but i don't find getting impeded by an enemy to hopefully find a puzzle all that fun and i think it would be more annoying to be in a puzzle and have all progress stop when I am trapped by the enemy.

Mirror Layers
----------

After watching Markiplier play the original version of Mirror Layers around 6 years ago, I was so excited to get my hands on a copy of this unique, horror-themed puzzle game. Gratefully, it was an even better experience than what I had anticipated.

Mirror Layers is an exploration-based, first-person puzzle game which entails learning the details of 5 tragic stories. All 5 tales center around previous residents of the apartment you find yourself trapped in. There's a mirror that will transport you to an alternate version of the apartment, and this is where you'll be doing a majority of your puzzle solving (as well as running from the occasional roaming adversary). The ""normal"" version of the apartment is not only a safe place, but it's also where you can save photos, notes and clues that you've accumulated. Additionally, Mirror Layers features its own social network called Propaganda, and you can work with other players via this network to solve puzzles as well as trade items back and forth (both actions being a requirements to complete some puzzles.)

Presentation-wise, Mirror Layers is great. The graphics are really good, and the audio is minimal but almost perfectly effective. Very little music is featured, but most of what is here is oddly fitting and appropriate. Player control is responsive enough, but I strangely found that it was easy to get my key bindings confused and chuck an item that I meant to closely examine, even with on-screen prompts.

As far as gameplay and puzzle difficulty, Mirror Layers does well. The puzzles were usually easily solvable with some time and thought and/or research on Propaganda. There were a couple of puzzles that gave me trouble for a moment, but I don't think that I needed outside help for any of them. Outside of that, gameplay was your typical horror fare: complete puzzles and get out of harm's way when a monster is lurking. There were a couple of complaints that I saw from other players regarding monster encounters being too hard or annoying, but I personally found the monster difficulty to be hard but still reasonable, and each seemed to have an understandable behavior after watching them for a while (especially the ""bosses"".) Additionally, I felt that monster art design was very good, especially the ""bosses"".

I really don't have any big complaints about this game. I do wish that it was easier to restart from zero, because I'd like to run through it again on another server, perhaps in another language. There were also a couple of rare and minor glitches like a flashlight shining through a wall, and finding a pertinent answer on Propaganda some times took a few page flips and a good amount of research time. That last one admittedly didn't happen often, and I don't feel like it detracted from the experience very much, if at all.

I'm really hoping that the developer has some sort of follow-up in the works, because I really had a great time with Mirror Layers, and I'm interested to see what the developer might do next. I say at least give the demo a try.",1,1694369162,961,0,103
212,1490980,"I don't think I'll have the heart to finish this, as horror has always been a difficult genre, but I can't help but recommend this on a few different principles.
This is like an escape room: you solve it together, not alone.
Your apartment is relatively safe, and to progress, you need to cross into hostile territory (which isn't hostile at first, allowing you to learn the layout safely), and learn how to use Propaganda.
Immediately before I even crossed, I was looking at hiding spots, which are certainly very useful throughout, and liberally placed.
I had to turn my mouse sensitivity up, but then it was alright.

My favorite part is Propaganda: you need to learn how to use it to progress. The first lock requires a key, but if you don't have the key, you need to download it from Propaganda. The only downside is if nobody plays the game, nobody will interact with you. Fortunately, everything you need to beat the game should already be there. From important files, to tips and tricks, there shouldn't be anything preventing the completion of the game. I hope they try something like this again, but bigger.",1,1693072060,43,0,60

When I first saw IMSCARED I had known the potential of the devs, now I can proudly confirm that.
Mirror Layers is an excellent horror & thriller game that brings an unseen perspective to the genre.
Even tho the 2017 demo was such a hit, from what I see the full version of the game hasn't got the attention it deserves. I guess it's because it took 4 years and people just forgot about it. And It's such a shame because every horror game fan should really experience this game.

About the cons of the game... The monster chasing sequences and the logic behind it was kinda lame tbh. Some of the puzzles were really difficult to figure out. And my biggest frustration is the ENDING! Ending was left so damn empty... WHYYYYY... Why didn't you really pay attention to the ending?

Anyway. Overall Mirror Layers was a wondrous experience for me and it's a must play game for horror game fans imo. With negative and positive sides of the game; thanks everyone who involved in bringing out this game.

221,1491040,"Way too aggressive visually. Very straining on the eyes to try and focus for even a short play session.

Bullet patterns and level design are incredibly simplistic and repetitive. Same can be said for all of the bosses.

Some powerups can completely trivialize the game. If you get the full power scatter shot you can literally just hold the fire button down for the entire stage and instantly kill every enemy as they appear on screen.",0,1625362770,21,0,778
222,1491040,"[b]TL;DR: Get it if you like side scrolling shooters with bopping music.[/b]

A small but mighty 2-D shooter. I had a fun time playing the eight mission campaign, which took a little over an hour to beat. 

I wouldn't say Binarystar Infinity [BI] is a super challenging game, but some enemies/bosses can be tough at first. The game gives plenty of extra lives and power ups to keep it accessible. And if you lost, you can start over from any previous level.

The power ups might be a little overpowered, however. The [spoiler]Bubble[/spoiler] power up is too strong in my opinion, since it will almost always hit enemies and allows for too little movement by the player. Stacking power ups is a thing, which looks cool but can make it too easy. A cool but debatable mechanic is the option to retrieve some of your power ups when your ship is destroyed. While I like keeping my preferred weapon, it can make the playing too forgiving.

Once you beat the game, the survival mode and boss rush keep replayability up. Survival mode is pretty relaxing, while boss rush is nostalgic of your first run.

My main complaint is how vanilla some of the bosses are. All bosses have pretty predictable patterns. One boss in particular felt extremely lazy and too easy ([spoiler]the seventh boss[/spoiler]). Besides that, everything else felt clean.

I would also suggest adding some extra graphic settings. There is a lot of screen shaking and white screen flashes, so settings to reduce/remove those would be awesome. I would also give more difficulty options for the campaign, like in reducing the number of power ups/extra lives available. Making the scoreboard contain online high scores would be cool too.

Lastly, the graphics and music are just spot on. I haven't heard good dark-synthwave like this in a while!

Overall, BI is a solid shooter that is worth the price. Give it a shot!",1,1612435424,85,0,18
223,1491040,"Good bullet hell, with both hori or vertical options.
Unlike many self-proclaimed retro shooters, this one rings true by that statement and genuinely sticks to a consistent and minimal aesthetic. The palette is composed of only black and white with rare hints of red for incoming bullets, enemy damage or pick-ups. Great feedback on hit confirms with an intense screen shake and visual explosion. It is admittedly a bit intense, but you strangely get used to the mayhem pretty fast. 

Perhaps most interesting of all was how consistent the bosses were in their behaviors. Each utilizes a primary wave of curtain bullets with a second one tying in shortly after. Then each has a movement gimmick. Boss 1 will move laterally and then dash to the edge of the player's section of the screen's real estate. Another boss will split in two to each side of the map and sweep almost to the edge of the screen with a laser tied in between them.

Like most shooters, it is not long, although its length is nothing to scoff at considering how well it does what it achieves and so consistently too. Survival, Boss Rush and then co-op branching options for each mode are also there. Boss Rush is worth highlighting since the onslaught of bosses is also met with a generous degree of pick-ups, so the balance of challenge and options available are pretty good.

Truly a fun endeavor with just the right balancing, with enough challenge to be somewhere in the middle of the skill level of an STG beginner and veteran.",1,1612814858,88,0,8
224,1491040,"Binarystar Infinity is an enjoyable little shmup with eight missions in Arcade Mode each with a boss at the end. The missions are scripted but the power up contents are random. I like the art style although it's not very easy on the eyes because of the high contrast. The movement is a bit odd compared to other shmups, a little bit of inertia and speed depends on the direction. You also start slow and you have to pick up speed power ups to increase your movement speed, however if you lose the speed power ups your ship is slow again.

It's nice how the weapons can level up, the spread weapon and laser can get really powerful, maybe a bit too much, although losing your upgrades by accidentally picking up another weapon power up is a bit frustrating, same as dieing and not being able to pick up your dropped power ups again. You could see it as part of the challenge.

You can start from each of the eight missions once unlocked which is nice for practice. When you've figured out all the boss attack patterns it's not hard to clear the game in Arcade Mode. Once cleared you unlock two new game modes, Survival and Boss Rush.

Boss Rush is quite enjoyable. You face off against all the bosses with a regular stream of power ups which you can either pick up or use for points. I'm not sure whether you should try to milk the bosses for power ups or kill them as fast as you can.

 I tried Survival Mode but that was really boring for 30mins, it was super easy with a fully upgraded laser and a ring of orbitals until I picked up the wrong power up and wasn't able to build up my laser again despite having 30+ lives.

The RNG has a strong impact, sometimes you get a ton of 1-ups while other times much less. I think it would have been better for balance if the 1-ups were scripted as well or earned through scores. It would be nice if you could choose to ignore a weapon upgrade you don't want, perhaps a button that destroys all power ups on screen. I've had multiple runs ruined by picking up a weapon upgrade by mistake or by not having a choice with the power up blocking my way. Alternatively keeping all upgrades and a button to switch weapons would work as well.

225,1491040,"Nope.

Don't be fooled by just the look of it. While the pixel art is definitely high quality, the game suffers from the simple palette. What is neat at first glance quickly becomes an eyesore and sure, aesthetic preferences aside, I found myself wondering if they put all that work into the art and design of the game at least add some more palettes or make it a few more colors...seriously. 

Being able to play vertically or horizontally had very little effect on my game experience or enjoyment to be honest.  I found myself playing mostly in the vertical layout. Music, controller support, the loose story and chapters were OK, definitely passable.

What really sucked was the game play itself. Now, I'm no S ranked super schmup pro but I found the difficulty level was pretty high but made almost 'higher' but annoying thing that happened through each session:

- SPD powerups? Get used to your ships handling only to have you hyper accelerate and veer into a nearby meteorite becaues you grabbed one by accident. Just make the ship one speed please...

- Weapons themselves are alright I guess, with some being vastly OP for a given chapter (that's the idea I guess?) but what's the point of levelling up your badass laser when 2 seconds before boss you are forced to go through a small corridor of debris and a grab the lvl 1 twin laser again....great, there goes that run. 

- Enemies are OK but maybe it's because the level design feels crowded and cramped for what it's throwing at you, it's tough to focus on a play-style of dodging bullets or clearing the screens quickly.

Anyways, hate to be a downer but the game just doesn't feel good. Couple of tweaks would make it a lot better, simplify and use that space to add a little more finesse to the gunplay and handling. I'd pass on this one, no matter the price, unless you're a schmup collector and like the look or something...",1,1701372553,62,0,90
226,1491040,"Binarystar Infinity is a correct, easy and fun Gradius or R-Type side scrolling shm`up. You advance destroying enemies and collecting items that improve your weapons or enhance your mobility or give you lives, the classic, and all this to prepare for the final boss of the turn.

The main arcade mode consists of 8 entertaining and exciting missions on a backstory of saving earth from the invading aliens.

The enemies are well designed and programmed to allow you to predict their movements and bullets. Killing enemies or destroying crates will drop power-ups such as different weapons, speed up, one up, and protective orbs. 

After completing the arcade mode, you can unlock the survival and boss rush mode to challenge yourself further. What makes this game truly shines is allowing the freedom of playing in either horizontal or vertical scrolling mode, and the co-op mode that allows your friend to join in.

233,1491040,"Binarystar Infinity is a very tedious 2D retro pixel/minimalistic side scrolling console ported arcade style shoot 'em up/bullet hell game, ripping off countless identical games before it, only worse.  You do get some fun pickups like orbiting defense orbs and so on, but any depth in gameplay is quickly eradicated by some of the laziest visuals I've seen.  Not only were the developers so talentless they couldn't work out how to do anything but pixel ""art"", but they only used three colours, black, white and red.  Ugh.  Taking ""We made our game look bad on purpose"" to new depths. 

Gameplay itself isn't winning any awards here either, apart from the hideously bad graphics making bullet detection difficult, the game itself is highly unpolished, movement is way too fast, and won't appeal to novices or experienced, die hard fans of shmups (yes, both of them). 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers.  

Because this is a console game, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the inferior console gaming appliances that the game was designed for.  These are unfortunate compromises and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was a second thought for the console-centric developers.  The game is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for consoles forces upon a game.  Once more, console peasants have made gaming worse for everyone.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the GameMaker Studio construction kit/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset favoured by amateur developers as it's cheap and requires little in the way of development skill, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  GameMaker Studio is most commonly used to make retro pixel shovelware and cash grabs.

A strong argument can be made that construction kits like GameMaker Studio should never be used to make games for profit, as the ""developer"", Ricci Cedric Design has done here.  These construction kits are intended to teach people some of the basic principles of game development, and to make small demos to pass around with friends.  They're not intended to replace to actual work of real, professional game developers.  So it's inappropriate when amateurs try to use these for profit, without any actual, real game development effort taking place.  This doesn't result in products that have any real meaningful value for gamers.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Binarystar Infinity has the almost scam-like price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.

I bought it because I saw that it had no reviews and I was intrigued by the gameplay trailer. lets get this out of the way, this is not an early access game, this could barely even be called an alpha. It barely works and half the time it feels like its about to fall apart at any second. the controls are stiff, the tutorial barely explains the mechanics, and its overall a very VERY underdeveloped game. However, I still find this game fascinating. 

The animations are surprisingly good when it comes to swinging around your ""sword"", and when dueling does work it honestly looks pretty damn cool. I can see what the dev is going for and I'm interested in the idea, but I honestly don't think this game should be for sale in its current state. Despite this, as Ironic as it sounds, I still think you should buy it, not for the game itself but to support the developer. while I don't think this game will ever be a masterpiece, I do think it has potential to at least become something playable and fun. the last thing I want to happen is for the dev to see low sales and terrible reviews and lose hope in developing this.

I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't because of the current state it's in. Don't get me wrong, this kind of stuff has a lot of potential. I can see this evolving into something people would enjoy!
What I like:
- The combat system. The combat system is a huge improvement from Pan Panda. The only thing I don't like about the Combat System has a lack of hints, so it's very easy to forget combos.
What I don't like:
- No FOV Slider
This one was really annoying for me 'cause I get sick with low FOV. It isn't THAT big of a deal, but it makes the game harder to play.
- Lag, Lag, Lag.
For some reason, I always get bad FPS in this game (I use a GTX 1070) when the minimum is a 1050 TI.
- Lack of Context
While I was playing Central (the only stage), I couldn't even tell a single thing that was going on besides a bunch of bad guys were spawning left and right.

Collecting up to 3 gems/stars on the way will unlock different outfit accessoires for your rider. Art style is simple but well done. Did not test the 2 player race so far.

What is a bit disappointing is the lack of physical snowboarding behavior. You do not carve down laying deep trenches and you will not put nice circles in the snow. The current gameplay is easier to get down the mountain. That is a good thing. I am missing that snowboarding thing though. You could replace that rider with a person on a sled or even worse: on ski - and will not see any difference.

245,1491090,"Nice gameplay, simple but with a good difficulty curve, especially if we want to get the 3 stars in each level, the music is exquisite and with a lot of soundtracks.

EDIT: I discovered that playing it with a joystick makes it 10 times better.",1,1646098233,707,0,736
246,1491090,"Disclaimer: I initially had problems with the Linux Native version with my controller, but they went away when I switched to Proton. I also only reached about 9 levels in, however, even in that small time I can feel this isn't a game that I want to continue playing.

Let's go step by step as I experienced it.

First¸ the colour customisation options were extremely limited, with no striking options like fluorescent colours. So going into the game, I felt that the character didn't really represent me and couldn't, this then meant I was slightly less implicitly invested in the actions of the character than I would have been otherwise.

Second, the levels. I kind of bought this with the intent of having fun snowboarding down a mountain, and that was fine and to a certain degree I did get that. However there wasn't any sort of ""open mode"" that would allow me to do that. The only option I had was for the story mode. For the first few levels of the story mode you are treated to sombre, semi-relaxing music, and to the developer's credit, it changes a second or two after it becomes boring and tired to the ear. The levels on the whole, while intended as a 'tutorial', were barely long enough for me to pick up any kind of speed and get used to the controls under speed, before I was yeeted out into the next level. It felt like I was having my plate taken away halfway through eating, at a restaurant, and doesn't match the slow, calming style and tones of the atmosphere.

I got to level 8, before I was told that the stars, which I had previously thought optional (and so didn't bother collecting any because there was some slight irritation with the path the game wanted me to take, and the path that I felt was natural to take and wanted to take as a player) were mandatory, and I would need X stars to proceed. So I got dropped back into the slightly shorter, previously completed level, and had to collect some stars. Ok, so I did that, only to proceed through a level and again be told to collect stars.

In most speed-based games, players will not have the opportunity, dexterity, or interest, to collect stars, and they should be either told in advance that they need X stars to go to the next level, or stars should not be required. You can see this in Sonic -- at no point in the original Sonic game are you told, you need to repeat a past stage to complete the next one, just because you didn't collect enough rings. I personally don't find collecting stars interesting, as I was fully onboard just to enjoy the mechanics, atmosphere, and storytelling. However you as a developer didn't allow me to do that! To make this worse, there wasn't (at least, I don't remember there being) any on screen indicator of how many stars I would need for the next level, and many of the stars were directly in front of obstacles, so either I slow down (and ruin the flow of snowboarding, which is the entire point of the game, right?) to carefully, painstakingly extract them, or I go to a much earlier level and farm stars until I have enough to progress through a sizable portion of the game. That's not something I'm interested in doing.

In summary -- the atmosphere is calming and sombre (Which I guess is more of a Celeste vibe than I expected from a game about an extreme sport), the mechanical gameplay is sufficient, but the game systems were not really very fun, the levels were much too short to be interesting, and the character customisation was minimal (to be fair, I think you get more gear (but not more colours) when you ""rank up"" or whatever).

I feel like this is a good and chill game (pun notwithstanding), were it not for these issues. It still feels sliightly early access on the whole, but the effort and time involved in making it come this far is very clearly there. I hope the developer has a nice day and finds the audience they are aiming for, but I just can't recommend this because... I'm not it.",0,1646349710,8,0,10

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,1649807114,75,0,44

262,1491120,"Very polished and futuristic racer. Soundtrack is very atmospheric with a hint of 90s dance! Played for about 20 minutes and there are lots of tracks and many ships to unlock which i guess the more you play and advance through the game you can unlock.  

The graphics are impressive and the speed is fast but you don't find yourself crashing into the side of the track a lot trying to control the ships! When you do crash you don't lose a lot of time trying to catch up to the other ships and trying to gain back your position.

The most interesting thing i found about this game is that in the options section of the game you can change the sensitivity of the steering and you can make the steering very accurate. The tracks i have played so far have some technical and twisty sections and i have spent a few moments changing steering sensitivity trying to get it right but as you progress through the game and unlock other ships, each ship has different characteristics such as increased handling or higher top speed.  Trying to find the right feel to the steering with each ship could be very frustrating!",1,1633805861,21,0,5

The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: Ruins of Limis is the first of three DLC's. It adds new quests, mechanics, and enemies to the game. You can either start a new story (just DLC) and import an old save file or start the DLC without a save file. 

I loved the main game. You can even read my review. I called it a love letter to the genre and it really was but this DLC is everything you hate about the genre. 

[h1] ""New"" mechanics? [/h1]
The so-called ""new"" mechanics are old mechanics revamped. Do you remember destroying the sausage boxes to stop enemies from spawning? Now you need to push statues to stop zombies from spawning... Poison gas is coming your way. Every turn there is more of it on the map. You need to push a lever to stop it from spreading while being in a fight with skeletons, etc. This wouldn't be too bad if everything else was great. 

[h1] Story [/h1]
The story is good enough. It fits perfectly in the game. The humor and everything else are just like in the main game. It's just too short. It feels more like a side quest of the main game. The questline is about 10 minutes long if you're not counting the battles. 

[h1] Battles [/h1]
This is where it gets cheap. I won almost every fight (except for like two) in the main game on the second difficulty (Or third, I don't exactly remember but I played on the same difficulty in this DLC). To make this DLC longer and harder they went the cheap way. You will fight against dozens of undead. It will start with like 10 enemies, which is fine and it's even like that in the main game. But in the third battle in this DLC (It's not a boss fight or anything. Just a regular battle.), you will fight against 10 or something. Four of them are mages in the back. Two of them will spawn new undead but not just one, one of them will spawn 3(!) by doing 1(!) action, and the other one will ALSO spawn 1 strong enemy in the same turn. This means they will just spawn 4 new enemies in one turn. The other mages will heal 2 or 3 undead at the same time per action. Others will freeze you or beat you unconscious. 

This is lazy game design. This is lazy work. They just went the lazy way to make the DLC feel longer and like ""more hours of playtime"" means ""a better DLC/experience"" - It's not. Not just that battles will take much longer, they also will unfair (Which I never had the feeling in the main game). 

[h1] Bugs, bugs, bugs [/h1]
UI bugs in the german translation make some text boxes unreadable. Sometimes clicking on an action doesn't register which results in a freeze (can't do anything). 

[h1] Summary [/h1]
This DLC is a neat idea. The story is well-written but they were short on content and went the lazy way to make it feel longer (Even then, it's pretty short). I am always a bit hesitant with DLCs since they often feel cheap and not worth the money (at full price) but this time, I had a good feeling. Well...

I really advise you to wait for a sale. There will be two more DLC's and there already is a season pass. I guess whenever DLC 3 is coming out, at least the first one will be on sale.

# see you raise the party level cap by 1 to 11;
# provides you with 2 'floors' (graveyard & subterranean crypts) along with new story faction specific gold tier items (weapons = necromancers; jewellery = vampires) that tend to have a buff with a caveat (e.g. 75% chance to inflict burn but the user will suffer burn when their health is below 20%); 
# 2 new sets of books to find;
# 2 side quests, where one requires you to trade 3 golden junk items in exchange for one of 4 gold tier necklaces (place swapping/perpetual drunkenness/ ranged push back/ ranged 3x1 attack).
#a few new mechanics to spice things up a bit (deactivate multiple switches, a mission with turn limit, a 3 way battle, a way to weaken a specific enemy class).

Would only recommend you play the DLC AFTER completing the core game as there is a spoiler regarding the plot.

Downsides:
# it doesn't take long to complete (5-6 hrs on normal) and would highly recommended you create 2 save profiles when the story provides you with the option of choosing your faction (necromancers or vampires) so you can experience both of the story options as the format of the battles will differ. Also allows you to select which gear you find to be better weapons or jewellery.

# the battles can be drawn out due to enemy heroes being capable of summoning cannon fodder troops.

282,1491140,"I have played the DLC with an expectation to hate it, based on the reviews. Played on EPIC difficulty.
But... It is actually good!

The main complaint about the infinite enemies had never happened to me. There were 3 or 4 battles where the enemy wizard had called the support mobs, but only once or twice per battle. The reinforcements in the main game were sometimes much more annoying. Overall, everything was quite balanced and manageable. Fighting many enemies wasn't a problem at all. The Wizard in your team finally has a chance to shine with the AOE spells.

Perhaps were I to chose to fight against the necromancers rather than the vampires, the mob spawning would be worse, but I'm very satisfied with how it went. Some of the battles were challenging at first, but started getting smooth after you learned your enemies. The story is fine, the levels are good. I wouldn't say there was any new mechanics in the DLC. It simply added one more exp level and continued the game story.

The fights are abyssmal in this DLC.
The original game was demanding at some times (I played at hard difficulty), but never was I so annoyed as playing this DLC.

Basically we fight against a group of basic enemies & summoners/magic users.
The summoners keep summoning new enemies and using group healing, while the other enemies keep AOE FREEZING you, so the frustration is kicking in really hard. 
You think you can use cc spells yourself on the summoners? Well, here comes the backup! Another summoners, healing and spawning more shithead enemies!
You think you have pretty tanky characters, who can resist some freezing effects? KEEP DREAMING BOY! For the whole DLC duration you are cursed with a physical/magical resist debuff BECAUSE REASONS, which basically turns your undestructable dwarf into a punching bag of chicken shit.

It then proceeds to chain stun, knock down, and freeze your characters with fights that demand you get impossible quick kills or be over run by units.

Those spawns will also summon more themselves. I am not exaggerating the numbers here. And probably  90 percent of them will have AOE and ranged capability. They will get three or four consecutive turns and you will get one in between. You still only get the same cramped space to set up and the AOE attacks will hit you within one turn.

320,1491150,"As most people do when looking at buying a new game, one of the usual ports of call is reading the reviews left by other players. Being objective & setting aside personal bias when doing a review should be a must, like every good journalist.... But ALAS!.... reading reviews is like navigating a mine field set within a booby trapped maze! You need discernment of the highest order to weed out the facts from the reviewer who has written a review based 99% of the time on their own personal experience, opinion & perspective. Their missive is always heavily laced with their IQ level & the narrative they give leaves you in no doubt as to THEIR personal view of enjoyment or lack thereof of said game. 

I often read game reviews with dismay because of the lack of UNBIASED, honest & objective insights. But at the same time I find myself laughing my a$$ off & shaking my head at the sheer lack of common sense, sense of entitlement & volume of blatant stupidity on display in the reviews left by others. At the time of writing this review there were a grand total of 10 reviews for this game here on Steam. Half were positive, half negative. So after having read them all I decided to follow my own motto “Buy it & find out for myself!” because as per usual the TRUTH would quickly reveal itself once I started to play & then I could see for myself exactly how on point my own discernment was in regards to the claims & statements others had left, especially the naysayers “don’t buy this squad!” I am delighted to say my discernment was ON POINT & I didn’t miss a single beat in my thoughts on what I had read good & bad from others reviews. These days I find myself reading the reviews of the games that peak my interest simply because of the “entertainment” value they provide rather than the “factual” info they should contain but don’t, sad but true. 

Sooooo, having said all the above, here comes what should be considered the bleeding obvious for ANYONE who loves this genre of game & uses the brain they have been given….

The 1st 3 user tags for this game are LOGIC, PUZZLE, ESCAPE ROOM…. Strange but true * insert sarcasm here! * How hard is it for people to comprehend this? This IS a puzzle; ANY puzzle requires you to use LOGIC to solve it. 

Enter escape room ->>> 
Take a GOOD LOOK at it for more than 3 seconds! ->>> 
Fire up brain to use YOUR LOGIC / GENERAL KNOWLEDGE to SPOT the clues ->>> 
Pick up the tools / clues ->>> 
THINK about who, what, when, where, why & how you should use said tools / clues to solve puzzle ->>>
BE PREPARED to think outside the box if need be.

Do it right & hey presto! You’ve escaped, & feelings of victory, self-worth & achievement flood your being making you eager & fired up to take the next challenge on. All of the above will happen naturally IF you simply stop & have a damn good look at what you see & will eliminate a lot of those NEEDLESS mouse clicks. Taking the time to allow the things you see to actually register in your brain is the key to any puzzle. 

THE GOOD: Visually, artistically, graphically - put simply…. GORGEOUS! 

Seriously, I want to compliment the devs for putting together a well thought out design visually making clue hunting & gathering a joy lvl after lvl. Every clue has its place & every tool goes exactly where it belongs. It all comes together in every scene to tell a story, THE story of that room & the solves flow naturally with NO WTF moments. It all truly flows in a logical manner despite the often magical enchanted vibe that washes over you while viewing the rooms. This game is without a doubt in my top 3 most favourite escape room games & I sincerely hope we get more lvls added to this game. I could not recommend this game more highly, if this genre is your thing - BUY IT! You won’t be disappointed.  
     
 THE BAD: The fact that NONE of these rooms come as wallpapers! I spend entirely way too much time gawking at the room, admiring every last detail because it is so beautifully done! 

THE UGLY: There’s only 100 levels.... N E E E E E E E D MORE LEVELS!!!!!

324,1491150,"I understand why the reviews are mixed and controversial.
The graphic part of the game is perfect. The quest is clear to find the key and the fish to get out of the place. But there is not any explanations how. The only clue is the differences between current place and the same place we saw the previous time. And then it is necessary to do some kind of pixel-hunting.
The game is an Escape Room type. And then this game is on a higher level than most of the game of this type. The game has positive points because of the graphics, but then I expect some improvement even in other sides of the game. I think the game is not balanced and it is a little boring after some time.
I wanted to give a neutral rating but it is not possible. I just expected something a little different.",1,1674735714,113,0,138
325,1491150,"(tl;dr version) Pros:

-Short, but charming dialog between the characters
-Nice imagery of the different worlds
-Multiple language options built into game
-Rapidly charging hint and skip buttons
-Steam Leaderboard available
-Steam achievements are pretty easy to get

Cons:

-Difficulty is all over the place - no gradient
-Hint button is either too much help or nothing at all
-Some puzzles seem badly designed
________________

For me personally, I'd give this a ""neutral"" rating, but I've only played 2 escape the room games ever so it is just my experience.

This is one of 3 Peaksel escape the room games featuring the character Mia.  This installment has a cute fantasy setting and you are helping Mia solve Balthazar the cat's 100 puzzles (levels or rooms) in order to return to her world.  I quite liked the graphics and the brief storyline, plus the cat's just cute despite his smug attitude.

After the first 5 really easy levels, the difficulty varies wildly from one level to the next.  You can set the game options to have the cursor change when you hover over an item which you are supposed to pick up, which does make things a tad easier on levels where the puzzle is to pick up certain items and then figure out how to use those things.  However, I still found myself doing a lot of random clicking to figure out what ""works"" with the amassed inventory in some of those puzzles. Others were ""huh, that's all it is?""  Still other puzzles were to play a minigame, most of which were variations on slider puzzles.  Several of the slider puzzles were poorly designed IMO as the ""finished"" image couldn't be determined without a long trial-and-error process which might take a few hours, or else had some odd mechanic which baffled me.  Considering how several of the Steam achievements are for using the skip button enough times and other achievements are for completing just 50 of the 100 levels and 10 of the many minigames (most levels have at least one minigame), makes me wonder if even the developer figures most people won't be able to ""do everything"".

It's a good thing there's both a hint and a skip button so you don't ever get hopelessly stuck and I'll cop to skipping about 25% of the slider puzzle type minigames, although I'm currently replaying to see if I get the ""aha"" moment on those.  The hint button starts out with giving you far too much help in the first 20 or so levels, where you get the entire solution if you click on the hint button.  After level 20, clicking the hint button just directs you to a minigame in many cases, and when you're in a minigame, the only option you get is to skip it if you get stuck.  This is rather annoying on the harder games where either the slider puzzle picture can't easily be determined, or if you just need a little nudge to get you started in the right direction or to progress.

I got the game for a buck on sale recently, so can't complain too much, but would have liked it more if I could have ""done everything"" as I'm not usually one for hitting the skip button that often, but if you enjoy cute graphics and escape the room games, worth checking out.",1,1674576745,2982,0,69
326,1491150,"Enjoyed playing :-)
Another non-scary escape room/hidden object-type puzzle game. You're outside for the most part, and the colours are jewelbright and cheerful. On the easy side, but ramping up towards the end. Not all puzzles super-intuitive, but not brain-frying either. And there's a hint system in-game if you get stuck.

Decent length, ok value for money, I thought.  Worked well on even simple gear and mouse.
Nothing violent, scary or stressful, so suitable for most everyone including kids or old grannies or anyone looking for something peaceful.

331,1491150,"BARELY recommended.  Since we don't have a depends button, I had to make a decision and it tilted only slightly towards  recommended.  I am adding a caveat, however.  I bought it as part of a bundle, on sale.  The game is not worth it at full price.  IF, however you don't hitting skip on some of them, you should enjoy enough levels to get your money's worth. 

 That said, about two-thirds of the puzzle levels are good and quite a bit of fun.  I would actually call them logical.  The artwork is pretty and based on those levels I would recommend.
However a lot of levels seem to be more a test of your vision than your logic.  You have to click on something that is difficult to actually see to progress.  I've even used a hint and then just spam clicked the area until I actually hit on something because you can't actually see what they are pointing at. This might be my eyes so not the reason I don't recommend, just a warning to folks who haven't got 20\20.
In fact way to much of the game is just spam clicking in the hope that you will actually find something that isn't really visible.  (Using the shovel to dig up something isn't really a logic puzzle if you have to just drag it over every patch of ground until you luck out. )
My biggest issue, and the one that almost led me to not recommended, is I have had two levels so far where an item in my inventory just disappears.  I just quit to write this review over the second incident.  I found a scroll, it was in my inventory, I looked it it but couldn't unroll it, so clicked the x to put it back in inventory and then it just vanished.  The hint is now telling me to do something with  chest that has a carving of said scroll on it and the scroll is gone.  It has not respawned, I checked.
There is also a lot of puzzles that don't tell you what you're supposed to do.  Luckily they have a skip puzzle button.  There is a few (those roll the wheels to match up the picture type) that if you are not absolutely perfect it won't give it to you.  Like literally shifted it by a pixel or two when I hit skip.

There are also a number of puzzles where you just have to mix things up and drag things onto other things and hope to stumble on a solution.  Often you do, but that solution makes no sense whatsoever.

I wish that when you do give up they would show you how to solve, too.

333,1491150,"This is a fun puzzle game that does not hold your hand.  In every scene you have to look for things that stand out and then figure out what to do with them.  The cursor won't light up so you have to really look for things though sometimes you need to take a few guesses. Once you find something you have to figure out what to do with it. For example you find a pick axe so what to use it on? Some levels have mini games or codes to find.  There are no timers so no stress. Every level comes with hints if you need them,which are usually enough to figure it out and if  you get really stuck you can skip a level or a mini game.  It's cute and also kid friendly.

If you are stuck then there is a hint to help, although I hate using it, always trying to find the key myself :)
What I'd like to see improved is the skip button - if you use it it will not tell you the solution, so you can't find out why you couldn't resolve it.

One or two sort of relied on moon logic.  There was one puzzle that was clever in how one deducts the four numbers for a chest lock but one had to guess around what order the numbers were in at the lock which could have been developed better.

351,1490180,"For that price, there is no reason this game should be this good.

I'm sad tho, there is a clear potential and lots of stuff, but the rng feels quite unfair. I would pay for just a bit more pollish.

The randomly picked enemies sometimes generate some utterly unfair battles.",1,1636941197,154,0,32
352,1490180,"Overall I had a great time with this game. Good stuff.

[b]GOOD:[/b]
[list]
[*]A decent variety of enemies. There are about 3-4 different skins for each monster, but they each have varying attacks and behaviours to keep things interesting.
[*]A large selection of craftable perks to potentially obtain.
[*]The controls handle well. Dodging and attacking feels responsive and enjoyable.
[*]Action-packed generally speaking. Enemies spawn in waves throughout a day, but if you take too long, the next wave will spawn in to keep you on your toes.
[*]Satisfying and appropriate sound effects.
[*]Great pixel art and animations.
[/list]
[b]NEUTRAL:[/b]
[list]
[*]Bombs (player ones at least) seem to have a larger vertical blast radius from the top of the bombs compared to the bottom. Maybe it just takes some getting used to, but I would have expected a more even blast radius.
[*]Enemies can move over and take advantage of any healing pools you might obtain from your perks, thus robbing you of needed health.
[*]Late-game enemies can sometimes spawn in earlier waves. Once you've played the game for a while, it isn't so bad as you know what to expect, but this can be tough on newer players I imagine.
[/list]
[b]BAD:[/b]
[list]
[*]Thematically, some of the enemies don't really fit. Various flying bugs, skeleton mage-looking dudes, and weird cows that slink across the ground. The game presents itself as Leonidus holding off the Persians, but sometimes you might not even see any of them in a run and you are just fighting various monsters.
[*]Spawner enemies are insufferable. They will often speed away much faster than you can walk or roll and you'll have to spend your efforts chasing them to the corners of the screen to kill them. If you happen to have 3-5 of them spawn in at once, you will only be able to sit there helpless and sob as your screen fills with foes.
[*]A few spelling errors on some perks, e.g. ""Sacrad Pool"".
[*]Certain enemies are incredibly strong and difficult to deal with (white scorpion Persians, spike shockwave scorpion tails, red/brown skeletal mages, etc.) Whilst one or two aren't too bad, having five show up can be outright impossible to manage. This is compounded when you are unable to defeat them in time and then even more spawn in from the next wave.

359,1490300,"TL;DR at the very bottom.

To preface this just a little bit, as a fan of Supergiant since the days of Bastion, I've always adored the shit out of their music. Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett have easily become my favorite duo for gaming soundtracks, and with every single game release SG has hit it out of the park in just about every department, including music. If you've not listened to their soundtracks before, please do, but make sure to play some of the games first; they 100% add to the emotional value of each OST without fail.

With the release and subsequent explosion of Hades hype, I became a bit worried -- I've seen a number of other companies go through something similar where the explosion of a certain game's popularity would push them into a point of either selling out or starting to settle into mediocrity while giving only to fans of the big entry because of how lucrative it is.

But that was not necessarily so with Supergiant. Now, I'm fairly certain this album was put together long before Hades got huge, but the thing is is that that game still had plenty to draw from in its library... yet Transistor, my favorite of the games, got the majority of the songs on this album, with almost every single one of its vocal tracks being represented. Transistor, probably the second least popular besides Pyre (which is also a game I'm glad got plenty of representation here!). That, along with the beautiful 8-minute Bastion medley, showed me that no, Supergiant absolutely still cares about old fans and their older games. They care about their roots, and they sure as hell still care about the art in their games. I found Hades to generally be lacking in some of the artistic departments that Transistor had shone the most in, but I have so much hope thanks to this album. I have hope that this studio will continue to make games that really do put the art up on a well-deserved pedestal while still retaining the sheer quality in gameplay and enjoyment that their past games have.

=====

So, now for the actual review. If you're someone who's just found Supergiant's games and music through Hades, I honestly don't recommend this album to you at all. What you need to do is take those $10 you would have spent on this, find Bastion/Transistor/Pyre, and pick up at least one of them (especially if one or more are on sale). I find that Transistor is the easiest to recommend out of them as it's the most similar to Hades gameplaywise, though all three of them are worthwhile games for sure.

If you're someone who's played at least 2 out of the 4 Supergiant games, it might be worth it just to listen to the stuff you know *and* to hear what you can from the games you've missed. It might just push you to give em a shot, cause it's definitely worth it.

If you've played 3 or 4 out of the 4 games, you obviously will want to pick this up. It's beautiful and worth twice its price, easily (or even more so -- I know I bought the vinyl).

Personally, I found the renditions of Never to Return, The Spine, and Vagrant Song to be a bit lacklustre compared to the rest. They weren't bad at all, but I think they either missed part of what made the original good (the simplicity of Vagrant and the heavy percussion and bite of The Spine) or happened to be songs that were meant to be looped (Never to Return and The Spine). It's unfortunate, but they do at least sound good anyway. I just think they're weaker than the rest of the album.

As for everything else, ohhhh boy. It opens well with We All Become, and In Circles/Lament of Orpheus/She Shines are great, but I think the standouts are most certainly the last three songs. In true Supergiant fashion, they totally nail the ending song(s): In the Flame, Paper Boats, and Remember the Bastion are superb closers to this album, and they alone are worth the asking price. Paper Boats has been my favorite Supergiant song for pretty much ever, and I think this version of it did it justice with its fresh take on the sheer emotional impact of the original. In the Flame perfectly captures all the feelings of hype I and others had when Pyre was first announced with those awesome trailers... and Remember the Bastion really does put together several beautiful themes into one medley package the game absolutely deserves.

This album is, in a few words, beautiful, heartfelt, and a labor of love. I really hope Korb and Barrett have gotten enjoyment out of all the stuff they've made together, because they deserve it for the top-notch quality of all of this music. This album is a perfect showcase of a lot of what makes Supergiant stand out as a special little studio in this heavily saturated industry. Hell, it even makes me wish I had the skills to help a studio like them out -- it brings back feelings I had as a teen when I played through the ending of Bastion and thought, ""Fuck, I wish I could work here someday.""

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Buy this album if you've played more than half of Supergiant's first 4 games, and consider buying it if you've played 2. Wait until you've played more of them if you've only played 1.

I only bought Transistor on steam so I could get the music for the player (originally got it at release on PS4).  So I'm as biased as you get, but if you don't enjoy Darren's music I doubt you're even here.  I love this album, just listened to the whole thing through.

If you aren't sure how you feel about new arrangements of music you love, on different instruments, please watch the videos they have here, they're long but the first gives you a good sampling of the tracks (not every single one, though), and even if you don't want to buy?

It's bold, memey, and in a lot of ways unforgiving. You need to have items, and grind a bit to get your creators up to a decent level to deal with the content, but when you're playing this game you're going at it with a certain mindset.

It wasn't 100% my cup of tea, but there are some highlights: this is the dev's first game, and it's actually (for the most part) complete. There are some BS moments (like instant death moments) and every content creator in the game has actually given their permission to be IN the game (which I think it awesome).

We follow a cast of characters who are more or less flat, uninteresting, and pretentious (all except for Debug the holographic cat that is); they're privileged, have little character growth or development, and the stakes and objectives for the characters aren't big enough to move the story along in an interesting way. I think the most interesting point in the narrative was the storyline involving Jey's character arc in chapter 3. Unfortunately, this does come across as more of a vanity project. The majority of the dialogue doesn't add anything of interest either. I appreciate the ambition of wanting to promote and transform an album of songs into a video game (especially considering OFK is virtual and comprised of members intimately involved within the video game space), but despite having so much going for it, the story (or lack thereof) just makes the whole game fall apart. 5/10",1,1714465684,915,0,387

But the music is great and the design is wonderful and the hellish depiction of Life In LA for the Youngs is pretty much on-key.  It's seems all entirely too realistic, such that the bowlderized brand names like ""Twibber"" and ""Cinamongram"" are jarring.

I really wanted to like this game, but the various scenes and stories that you work through are all rape scenes. While I know that is a pretty common troupe in the grand scheme of things, the stories herein are also coupled with things like Bestiality, Drug Induced (and explaining away the assailant's fault due to being drugged), Use/Threat of Violence, etc, etc. The adult content is also censored, which was disappointing (pixilated body parts don't impress me), but not a huge loss since I wasn't into the story much anyways. 

As far as the mini game (chase) content is concerned, it was actually well done. Not super hard or anything, but does require a little bit of planning. Even the ""hard"" maps only took a play or two to figure out. If you are not looking to play with the content patch and just want the mini game content, the game is alright. It's because of the mini game that I don't feel it was a total waste of time.

Otherwise, I would recommend the creators explore other content stories and scenarios that don't require 4 scenes of rape to complete - and certainly remove so much of the other content specially bestiality. While I get that there are ""Non-Human"" characters in fairy tales, there was way too much animal action for my liking. The art was good (minus censoring) and the mini game was enjoyable.

Unfortunately, ""what it is"" also includes being short. Despite my five hours on record you could probably blaze through in half the time. Considering the basis for this game (ie: fairy tales - predominantly European ones), there is a wealth of material that could have been used. I would have liked to see this game cover roughly double the number of fairy tales (at least). That said, I'd be lying if I said I felt ripped off for what I paid, but I wouldn't call it spectacular value either.

The most damning thing I can say about this game is that it seems to be content being good enough; which is a real shame as it very obviously had the potential to be amazing. I enjoyed it, I just wish it had lived up to the promise it shows.

The art direction is top notch, designs are simple yet consistent and nothing feels out of place visually. The character and enemy 2D sprites are hand-drawn and beautifully animated, even though not super high-framerate, all animations are fluid and work really well. The enviroment, backgrounds and particle effects are also pretty and detailed. Gameplay is tight and fairly simple, as far as character movement and actions go, everything works and I had zero problems related to controls, it played perfectly from start to finish using a PS4 pad. The game has a couple of ""issues"" that might turn some people off, though. The english translation is understandable at best, but the story is simple and even with the bad translation I was able to get what the characters meant to say. But the biggest deal-breaker here would be the difficulty. This is definitely not a casual game, a lot of people might be drawn to it by the cutesy catgirl and then get filtered by a boss fight or plataforming section. Don't get me wrong, some of the boss fights are really well done, but you can only mash your way through it for so long. Some bosses require a lot of patience and precision, you will have to ""obey"" the patterns and do it right or else you will fail. My biggest gripe with it though was a couple of plataforming sections, which are unnecessarily punishing and borderline unfair, not because of character control, but level design. Fortunately, with the right set of items and upgrades, everything is doable, I was able to get 100% map and items without much suffering. Another thing that might piss off some players is the fact that some essential items are hidden a little too well, but then again, only the dedicated players will find victory here.

I think it's kinda unfair that this game currently has a ""mixed"" review score, seeing that a lot of effort was obviously put into it. Game journalists need to stay out, there's no easy mode.

It's an interesting follow-up. The first one is more cohesive overall, but I liked the many different boss fights in this one. The bosses have simple patterns, but it's fun fighting them. I kinda wanted a boss rush mode.
There's also a large focus on keys here, which might be a bit confusing since you may not remember which key you needed to open which door, but you get the ability to warp to any of three areas from anywhere in the game quite early. You can mark rooms in the map so you remember to check them out later.
Lots of exploring to do. There were a few areas I ended up never visiting in my first playthrough, and about five bosses I only fought when I replayed in Hard Mode. I enjoyed the platforming challenges later in the game.

3. Sounds are fantastic on the loco and coaches. 
4. Variety of timetable stuff to keep you busy

CONS
1. Only available on one route (HRR) which is weird considering it has LZB fully implemented. Dovetail really needs to implement more services, even if this means generic sub ins. 
2. I initially bought this for 2781 yen (Discount included) when it went live and how it is 1000 yen cheaper only a few hours later (base price not extra discount stuff) Why would you do this DTG?

From this American's perspective with *some* knowledge of DB stock and railroading.... it's stunning (and this is key for my review, i don't know the exact measurements of the windshield wipers... sorry)

It looks great, worn paint, splatters, grease throughout where it would be. Fine details on cab and undercarriage & throughout

It sounds great, from shutting the drivers door to inserting the key. Traction motor whines and slips, fans, announcements, horn (sounds great inside but identical to ICE on exterior) very decent overall

Physics feel nice,  heavy, not to quick to put the power down - must take your time. Braking included... brakes amazingly crazy strong like all DB locos :p but not over the top

Coaches look and sound great, highly detailed from the carpet and other variations in 1st and 2nd class to the legible and detailed warning labels (in diff languages)

PZB 'seems' to work with my limited knowledge - i've yet to try LZB

Performance wise, seem fine - no hit for me and my potato PC

Think it's got around about 30 services on HRR and 3 scenarios

So far after about 1.5 hours i'm convinced its one of the or thee best DB loco currently in TSW2

Majority of work came from TSG's Maik Goltz (sp?) whom has created some of the best DB rolling stock currently in the game. 


I'm looking forward to many hours at horribly failing PZB with this beast.

A few loco DLC's before have had Cab cars, why not this one? Also, you can only drive services on HRR, which is not a good route for this loco. The Loco is LZB compatible, but can't drive under LZB unless you wanna do the process of setting up an entire scenario. Lastly the left screen, the major electronic information screen, is just a lazy copy paste from a 185, which looks nothing like the 101 MFD. The speedo goes to 160 instead of 220, and the PZB mode is totally wrong. Will recommend this only when this loco will have gameplay. Also the horn sounds good from the inside but uses the horrible default german horn outside, can this be changed for once?",0,1619168136,0,0,19
479,1490110,"I can confidently say that this is a high quality DLC. The Loco and the two different wagons have to be on the highest level of authenticity visually and especially sound wise.

This is the first loco where I tend to move my outside camera to the wagons instead of the Loco, because the running sounds are so accurate, it brings flashbacks to the times when you sat in these wagons.
The Loco sounds are brilliant. The engine running, speeding up, door closing and the in cab announcements are absolutely spot on. You get some functions like the window interlocks. 
Of course the Loco is fully Sifa, PZB and LZB compatible.
The driving experience differs more than I expected to other German locos and is accurate to real life, as for example it simulates the 101's superslip. So don't wonder if you get shown wheelslip when applying to much power - the 101 still gets most of the power on the track. 

The carriages have working pis monitors inside and outside, and for the first time you can interact with some break setting handles on the wagons themselves, which do influence your breaking.

Now for the elephant in the room:
Yes the Loco is currently only available on HRR, which is a rather short route and has no lzb sections. But I find the driving experience here worthwhile due to the winding track layout and The additional stops in between.

It has been confirmed by the devs, that they will add 2 services to the upcoming Hamburg Lübeck route, and that they will also try to add it to any upcoming german route that would allow for IC services.
Plus, a seperate team will try to get it on existing routes. No guarantee or time frame, but they want to try. 

And regarding some criticism:
-it only adds services to one route - yes that is true, but it is also true for every other loco dlc so far, so what did you expect?

-there is no cab car - true and this is honestly the biggest draw back. I can kidna understand it if it was not possible in the time frame and the allocated resources, but it has a bitter taste to it. They however acknowledged the request for one, so time will tell if we will ever get a control car.

486,1490110,"This DLC is one of the best from DTG so far. It really raised the quality to a whole new level.

The model of the locomotive and the passenger cars are pretty nice. The feel of driving physics seems to be quite legit in general. Now here's what's really unusual but really great about something from DTG: sounds. The sound of 101 is really good! So good it really makes it a pleasurable experience driving the locomotive. I only wish DTG would focus on doing that for all of their future content ( which so far didn't happen, unfortunately ). 

There's maybe two major pet peeves for me with this DLC: no driving cab and although the amount of services this loco has on Hauptstrecke Rhein Ruhr ( HRR ), most of them are pretty short and you can't enjoy to drive the loco at maximum speed with LZB ( 200 km/h ). This clearly could be possible on HMA if there was the driving cab, so that it would allow to at least make push-pull services going to / from Munich. Also the lack of a restaurant car is a bit annoying, but the driving cab certainly is what I miss the most.

Even despite this, I do highly recommend getting the 101. We'll most likely get more services with them in future routes and hopefully on routes where you can drive a bit longer with the 101. The locomotive is excellent and the team definitely did good with this one.",1,1620993147,0,0,22

I was very impressed with the sounds as well. There is a very subtle whine that seems to come from the air vent or perhaps a simulated computer fan that makes it feel even more like you're there in the cab. There is also sounds from the undercarriage when you travel over points and switches, unlike some other locos in this simulator.

But, DTG only built the first and second class coaches not the baggaga car and bistro. There is no cab car, but to be honest I not miss it.

The pack is used as substitution and for some additional services at other routes. You can see it at Hamburg-Lubeck and Dresden-Riesa.

My driving tip: keep the throttle low to avoid wheel slip. It has n AFB Cruise Control, but even then do not give it full power.

Be aware that you need the HRR route, which is not particularly interesting as well to be able to use this DLC.

492,1490110,"Probably the best train I've ever driven in TSW2! It's was a really good choice that DTG remake this train from TS Classic for Train Sim World 2. Sounds exactly the same as the real life DB BR 101! From the voice feedback when you acknowledge a signal to that iconic sound it makes when it reaches 25km/h. It even comes with Intercity cars which also have realistic sounds.

But because this is an add-on from DTG that means it's not 100% perfect. Something is missing from the consist. It might be obvious to some. Did you notice it? Yes the steuerwagen(control car) is missing from the end and maybe the bordrestaurant(on-board restaurant). Without the control car it's impossible to reverse out of stations with no possible way of going around.

494,1490110,"I truly think that this is currently the best locomotive DLC available for TSW 2, and now that it can be used on more routes than just HRR like how it used to be shortly after release, i am convinced that this is an absolute must-have for anyone who drives German content.

Pros:
-Great model and texture quality, the slight weathering and dirt effect give this locomotive a very realistic appearance.
-Realistic driving feel/adhesion/physics, driving this really feels ""right"" and as if you are actually driving a heavy train.
-Available by default on other routes (Hamburg - Lübeck, Riesa - Dresden), the high-speed route Köln - Aachen and with mods it can also be used on München - Augsburg.
-Fully working LZB on the high-speed routes.
-Great sounds.

Cons:
-One of the biggest cons, which still limits the scenario possibilities: the IC cabcar is missing.
-SiFa pedal sound can (and most likely will) stop working after a while which makes it become completely silent.
-It suffers from the same problem as a lot of other European locomotives in TSW 2: it spawns with the marker lights on by default. This isn't necessarily a huge problem but it's a bit annoying to fix every single time.

Additional notes:
-This locomotive is more challenging to use than most other locomotives currently available in TSW 2 because of the realistic physics, it has realistic adhesion so it slips more easy.

This DLC used to be very limited because of the (lack of) availability on other routes, but this is no longer a problem, and it is able to be used to its full potential, so again: this is an absolute must-have in my opinion.",1,1649082495,0,0,1

On the same livestream, Matt said he'd like to release the 101 Cab Car in due course, but that wasn't a commitment, which is very disappointing.

BR 112 is virtually a copy of 143 with adjusted scripts and few things in cab, sounds are overall mix of 143 and 155. Here as well no testing was done by developers, as such basic things as locomotive break are not working at all, and just like 143, it spawns in incorrect configuration (ie. rear lights in front, no lights in rear). The 112 even has a sticker that highest speed is 120 km/h while the loco is 160 km/h, it's just a lazy copy and paste.

To be honest, the route is great and if you like german routes, go for it, but I just will not give a thumbs up until DTG starts to deliver at least a basic expected quality.",0,1620927657,0,0,6
504,1490111,"I've seen the first stream of this route and immediately saw too many bugs. I would have hoped the devs would have listened to feedback ( mine included ) from the Twitch live stream or the Train Sim Community Discord. Then again, I probably should have written my feedback over the DTG forums as it is the official place to provide feedback, I guess. I don't really feel that it would make a difference, but who knows.

Anyway, I'll start with the positive things I've seen on this DLC:

+ The route itself looks pretty nice. It is nicely detailed, generally quite a nice ambient to it, looks good.
+ The train services are rather appealing as there can be quite a bit of traffic at least not far from Hamburg. Had an RE service overtaking an RB at some point, that was quite cool really.
+ Good to see a freight-vocational Taurus, that's definitely a welcome addition. But don't fall for this just yet... see the negative part of it.

Unfortunately, I believe that's about it all for positives.

Negatives:

- BR 112:
1 - a great loco that I looked forward to see. Unfortunately, the major disappointment of this DLC. The exterior model outside looks quite OK. Some people pointed out it looks a bit strange, but maybe that is because most people are used to how a BR 143 looks like. I can be wrong about this, though. It looks OK to me at least.

2 - Sounds are a mess. They are completely unrealistic. Maybe I would be willing to accept it if at least the ventilator sounds were as loud and as accurate as the real one. The ventilators are possibly the most evident sound that one can hear on a BR 112 ( and even the BR 143, which suffers the exact same problem - sounds recycled? ) 

3 - The cab instruments are off proportions. The needle gauges for traction effort and speed are not accurate. The main pressure brake gauge is also smaller than it should. The train brake lever is too small ( the ball at the end of it is also too small ). The same with the locomotive brake handle. Please do make an investigation of what a cab of a BR 112 looks like. Even better, you could even take virtualRailroads' cab as an example! 

4 - The ammeter needle is not working properly. One power notch increases from 0 to 500 AMP. It should NOT do that. The same behaviour happens when using the dynamic brakes...

5 - Speaking of dynamic brakes, those are not even deployed unless you apply full train brakes. The 112 uses a blended dynamic brake with the train brakes, so the loco uses both dynamic and air brakes right from the 1st notch of train brake. 

6 - Passenger information screens are not manually adjustable like we can do on the BR 146 and some other rolling stock. Why is there a missing quality consistency on most of your work? I just can't understand it.

7 - Why doesn't the Ebula screen work for this loco? Again another lack of quality consistency... Yeah they are sort of useless at this stage, but the community already found a way to use it. At least make it working properly just like all other locos...

8 - The engine temperature is not simulated ( or is it? ) and thus the temperature indicator in the cab is not working.

9 - There's some more other minor bugs that should be looked into.

Now for the Taurus...

1 - Recycled horrible sounds. Sorry guys, at first try I get it, but at second try? No excuse. The Taurus tone sounds are very unique. Yours sound very fake, synthesised. 

2 - The traction effort display is in the incorrect display. It should be on the right side of the loco, where you've placed the Ebula.

3 - The AFB can get broken if you deactivate it while having the AFB lever at some position. The AFB needle remains on the position where you turned it off and it won't move from there anymore. The AFB needle should be reset to 0 km/h as soon as you turn off the system, or at least that's how I believe it works. 

4 - Not exactly sure if this is related to the Taurus but the car transporting freight wagons do not have tail markers when I drove a service with the Taurus leading. 

5 - There's possibly even more things I haven't looked around because for me, the loco is still not good enough to enjoy driving. Just like the first DB 182. A shame, really. The exterior model looks pretty good.

For a final note on this DLC: 

The included rolling stock is what really kills the experience on this. There's of course some silly bugs on the route but that happens, they aren't anything game breaking really ( unless of course there are some which can be game breaking, but I haven't found any... )

I would enjoy driving this route if the rolling stock provided would have at least some decent sounds and would have a good quality consistency like the previously released DB BR 101 - that loco really raised the quality bar to something you couldn't deliver on this DLC. Sad. Unless bugs are fixed, I won't be repurchasing this again. Refunded for now.",0,1620947840,0,0,22
505,1490111,"This would be a great route. If it were done with a bit more care!

I am from Hamburg and I feel at home on this route. The stations look great and the buildings and landscape along the track are fine.
The scenarios are fun and the timetable mode provides a good variety including the BR101, although I would have liked to see an ICE around Germany`s busiest train station.

But there is this giant BUT

Besides a number of bugs that will hopefully get fixed sooner rather than later, like for example the BR112 constantly derailing when the emergency brake is applied (hardly avoidable when trying to master the PZB), the passengers and player having difficulty using the front door on the DoSto steering cab at Hamburg Hbf, the cab lights being reversed at the beginning of a drive and so on, the route is just absolutely dead.

It`s the worst at Hamburg Hbf, the biggest train station in Germany by Passenger numbers, that regularly has two trains behind each other at the same platform to cope with these numbers (which is actually simulated).
On most scenarios and timetable drives, my train was the only one in the entire station and there were maybe 20 to 30 NPC`s on all platforms combined. This is just ridiculous. Even in Scenario planner there are only 3 platforms available to fill with trains to make it a bit more bearable. Why cant you have some random AI trains at the unused platforms? I wouldn`t even care if they were completely stationary. Do anything to make it feel like this is an actual, real place with traffic...
And it`s not much better at the other stations along the line. Lübeck is a lot smaller but there should still be atleast one or two different trains visible.
Also there are way too few passengers. It`s not as bad or noticable as on the Bakerloo Line (where the station being entirely empty at Picadilly Circus at 5:30pm is apparently to be normal) but still I had runs with literally bot a single passenger boarding the train on the entire journey.

507,1490111,"It's okay; it is a pretty route with many choices of trains to run services with, but there are some big flaws. The number one issue I have is that PZB is broken: 500Hz magnets do not work, and I have had the emergency brakes tripped while approaching a stop aspect even while adhering to the standard O-mode speed restrictions. This is to me unacceptable, as this should be implemented correctly in every German route they put out. Also, there seems to be some optimization issues when you are within 15km or so of Hamburg. During their showcase stream this was apparent, although they blamed it on poor stream quality, but for me on my machine it performs exactly as was showcased during their two preview streams of the route. Also the DB BR 112 has a very washed out instrument cluster, while I know this is ubiquitous in TSW2 when driving in daylight, you would really hope such a thing would get some attention as it is obnoxious when you can barely see the indicator lights while you are driving.

While these issues are certainly annoying in my case, for you it may be passable. There are certainly the usual positives for a TSW2 route to be had here, so have at it if you think my points are not something that would bother you.",0,1620938968,0,0,2
508,1490111,"The route it self looks good and very detailed but there are a ton of bugs and errors:

-Wrong DoStos are included (platform hight is higher than doors)
-The 112 does have the same bugs (wrong panthograph up, red lights on while dostos are connected, loco spawns with red lights in front...) as the 143 (even a few more bugs) because it is basically a copy and pasted loco
-No S-Bahn driving around in Hamburg
-Not enough people walking around in Hamburg main station
-Cab car spawns with no red lights on when it is in the back of the train
-The ""Aufrüstautomatik"" of the 112 is not simulated
-Sounds of the 112 and the dostos are terribly bad
-I found a place where there was no overhead line for electricity

If DTG does quality control probally all those bug would not have found the way in TSW2. And I guess there are a lot more bugs than I found. DTG please fix this mess!

EDIT: 
I removed a few negatives in my list above because they actually got fixed. 
        
BUT STILL it is a mess. I've recently noticed that the BR112 has the wrong Speedometer.
It misses a little display to show the LZB speed that will be active in the amount of kilometers that are displayed in between the Speedometer and the Tractive effort display. So basically the LZB isn't even usable.
The bug where the dosto spawns with no red lights on is still there, wrong Pantho-Bug with Ai trains is also still there (same with BR143) and Locobrake does still not work. And let's just not talk about the headlights of the BR112 when it spawns... The BR112 is just a mess and not worth the 30 Euros.

509,1490111,The DB Class 112 is arguably the worst loco I have driven on the whole of TSW2 in terms of the braking. The power cruise is a nice feature to have unless you're travelling downwards - but I can't get around playing with the Class DB 112. The DBpbzfa 766 isn't any decent as well as it has a habit of jumping power or completely cutting out when accelerating and decelerating/braking. What is weird is that the DBpbzfa 766 on Main-Spessart Bahn doesn't even have any issues such as this - which is odd considering they're both the same model and files.,0,1621618341,0,0,10

511,1490111,"Lets start with the positives:
The route itself is decent, has some nice scenic areas with the usual sorts of details such as working PIS as well as some rather quirky easter eggs at Hamburg. Lengthwise is also fairly decent being 64km (38 miles) it's adequate for a moderate run.

The scenarios included are meh, but as with any other route released by DTG, I haven't really found any that exciting or challenging,  but that's about as much as I can positively say about it.

The negatives:
The DB 112 which is supposedly the new loco for this route is mediocre. Whilst the modelling itself isn't too bad, it's not the greatest that we have seen from DTG before. Whilst it is ok to drive, the overall sounds (which are taken straight from the 143) completely ruin the immersion for me, it feels dreary and very disconjointed.

The DOSTOS have absolutely NOTHING new about them. Whilst now we do have first class in the intermediate carriages they are the same old boring Gen 4 ones which have been used FAR too much within the German side of TSW content, DTG seriously need to stop using these and actually come up with something new and different for once. Lastly, the type used are NOT prototypically accurate for the route they run on. Complete and utter laziness is all I have to say about them.

The 182, nothing new about it apart from a different livery. Still feels awful to drive, poor acceleration physics and has really dodgy motor sounds. Again, was this the best DTG could do?


The freight wagons, still the same boring old Habbins, Laaers, Roos and Sggmrss we have seen before, nothing new or remotely interesting about them in any way.

The performance:

For the most part I was getting a good solid 60FPS, however the Hamburg area was stuttering really badly for me, and according to others, they also have the same issue too.

535,1490112,"This is the best DLC DTG has released in a while but I do have some constructive feedback.

The Good:
Not too many bugs
The train is nice
The World is more detailed than some recent routes

The Bad:
The world is dead without more AI traffic, especially at Glasgow
Why is there only one train? Not great value
Overhead lines are much less detailed than some TSW2 routes (Rivet games is great at these) Where are the terminating masts near junctions? (The Arosa line was perfect for this).
Not enough variation in scenarios due to the single loco.

The Horrible:
DTG is about to launch the Class 313 for 20 USD, this is basically the same as the 314 which is already in our libraries now but they expect us to pay 20 more dollars just to play it in East Coastway despite the fact that 90% of the differences are just that there are shoes instead of a pantograph.

Recommendation:
This is a fine route, but it is not a great value because it only comes with one loco. It is appalling that DTG is going to make us pay full price for the 313 even if you own the 314. At least this route is better than the recent messes which have all been under-detailed bug-filled messes. I would recommend it, but if you can wait for a discount.",1,1623944606,0,0,50

it's okay?
I see no flaws with this route really, no bugs, but lack of other trains on the route is a bit. . . bad. . . would be nice to have diversity as I know a lot more trains run here.

the only other downside is that there is no 6 car trains. which is not that bad unless you are for ultimate realism, which to be fair I am, but at this point at least we got functional trains instead of non functional crap.

scenery is great though, sounds are great and I havn't found a single bug yet

I'm going to put as little effort in this review as dovetail does with most of their routes so I'm gonna end it here

537,1490112,"The 314 is great, it's one of the most nicely detailed trains in the game so far, I think. It has some of the best sounds in TSW2, too, thanks to Armstrong Powerhouse. (In fact, I would say that maybe the only two better-sounding trains at the moment are the Class 43 and Class 166 from Great Western Express, which have received revamped sounds after being brought to TSW2's preserved collection.)

Cathcart Circle, including the Neilston and Newton branches, isn't the longest route, but the detailing is really great. The catenary poles are new and custom to this route, and while that doesn't sound like a big deal, it really is--it's the kind of attention to detail that usually gets lost when Dovetail Games produce a route. You can immediately tell that this is one in which the terrain was hand-crafted and assets were hand-placed, instead of relying on the scenery autogen tool they've been working on to get the basics down. I suppose that's the trade-off of having a shorter route, but you can immediately see and feel the difference when you compare Cathcart Circle to something like Southeastern High Speed.

Yes, there are some minor nitpicky details. The in-game stop/objective markers, for example, want you to stop at the end of the platform as a 3-car EMU, even if such a consist would normally stop further up the platform in real life. The shops in Glasgow Central are flat 2D images, which looks a little odd, but... okay, I understand that the time and processing power required to model generic storefronts probably wasn't worth it.

I think the biggest negative, in my opinion, to this route is that only including one train is a step backward and sets a new (and unfortunately lower) bar. There are only 16 Class 314 sets in real life, and all of them seem to be used in the timetable here, which means the route doesn't feel particularly busy. Hopefully there will be more than one loco DLC in the future, to add some more liveliness to what is otherwise a very enjoyable route to drive.",1,1623845946,0,0,8

540,1490112,"The route and train are well done. Glasgow Central looks good, there is a network with the circle line and two additional branches, though I am not sure the end points are natural.

The class 314 is another UK commuter train, like we have seen so many already. The differences are small and they are easy to drive, but nothing to get excited about (I do not live in the UK, that may make a difference).
You also get a railtour with a variety of pulling locomotives if you own the Northern Trans Pannine route.

The major minus for me is gameplay. They did what they can, but Glasgow with only one type of commuter train does not look good. No freight, no shunting, no express trains, just stopping commuter trains. It really causes little excitement.

I bought the route with an 80% discount. This makes it more or less worth the money, but even then not really a must have for me.

It's really good!

Pros:
- Class 314 is detailed with great sounds. It even has a guard panel! Just insert the guard key in the drivers booth and you're good to go. There's no actual guard mode implemented in-game though :(
- The route is short but well made and detailed. It's also self contained, you can drive the same train for hours!
- I like the collectibles. I'll try to get them all this time.
- Services are pretty short overall which for me prevents boredom.

Cons:
- Glasgow Central feels very empty with just a few 314s on the platforms at any given time.
- Snow textures have a sharp edge where the roof starts at Glasgow Central. I can overlook that though.
- Just one train (class)? Another one would add more variety to the route. Maybe as DLC? I'd buy that.

548,1490112,"Although this is a small route, I still thoroughly enjoy it. Here is my review on the Cathcart Circle Line:

Pros:
~ The Class 314 is a very well-modelled train. It's a good and accurate representation of the real train, although I've never actually been to Glasgow, let alone seen a real 314.
~ Sounds aren't too bad either. I noticed that the horn sounds the same as the AP/Waggonz Class 314 in TS20xx. I like how you can hear the motors in reverse when the brakes are applied.
~ The stations are highly-detailed, and so is the route overall. My favourite station is Muirend, and my favourite area of scenery is the section between Patterton and Neilston, especially since it includes the Waulkmill Glen Reservoir Viaduct.
~ Overall, DTG did a good job capturing the feel of Glasgow and the surrounding area. It's a good start for Scottish routes in TSW2.
~ Driving the Class 314 is quite an engaging experience. Although I'm not in favour of driver-only operation, I still find it fun when you get to press the buttons to open and shut the doors.

Cons:
~ As per usual, the route is very short. As stated on this store page, it's total length is only 20 miles long, which is quite disappointing (especially seeing as there are routes as long as 52 miles in TSW).
~ Only one train is included, and that's the Class 314. I find this very disappointing, although the 314 is fun to drive. I would have liked to see at least one more ScotRail EMU - such as the Class 318 or Class 380 - included, as it would make the route more diverse and enjoyable. I noticed that several stations even have stop markers labelled with '380'; I wonder if that means DTG are going to make the Class 380 in the future.
~ The lines into / out of Glasgow Central are unrealisticly quiet. In real life, the station isn't just served by the Cathcart Circle trains, it's also served by Avanti West Coast (with Class 390 Pendolinos), Cross Country (with Voyagers and HSTs) as well as many more ScotRail routes.
~ There are a lot of missed opportunities on this route. Many lines of the Glasgow Suburban network aren't included, such as the Hamilton Loop, which continues past Newton and onto Motherwell via Hamilton Central, plus the Larkhall branch. If that was included, DTG would have to add the section up through Cambuslang, Rutherglen and possibly Partick as well.
~ I think only including the ScotRail Saltire livery was a poor choice, since not all 314s received this livery. Some remained in their old, albeit debranded SPT colours right up until their retirement in 2019.
~ Another reason why only including the 314 was a bad idea is because only 16 of these units were ever built. This means that there's potential to come across more units in the game than what existed in real life, which isn't very realistic at all.
~ There don't seem to be any 6-car trains available in Timetable Mode, although they are present in the scenarios.

Side note, I find it a little puzzling that only the 314 was included, although they did run on the Cathcart Circle in real life. The reason I find it puzzling is because none of these trains are in service anymore. 15 of them have been scrapped, while unit 314209 is being converted to run on hydrogen.

Overall, I think the Cathcart Circle is a great route, albeit with plenty of room for improvement. What we have at the moment is still good, but it could be made much better with - at the very least - the addition of the Class 380 Desiro. I can safely recommend the Cathcart Circle DLC for TSW2, although I would advise waiting until it's at a discounted price.",1,1630212669,0,0,14
549,1490112,"My first impression after a couple of hours of play is that I like it. This is my kind of route. Lots of yellow and red signals. An elderly train which means you need to actually get used to it because it doesn't accelerate quickly and doesn't brake quickly and the force applied from the brakes especially when it transitions from rheostatic to air is variable and interesting making for a fun and challenging drive.

Things I really like
* The buffers at Glasgow are fantastic - wonderful level of detail, and better yet each one has individual stains and marks - * I wish they'd compress when you bump them with a train...
* The Glasgow station itself is great. I think modelling with this level of detail on this line is warranted because most services start and finish here.
* There is a nice variety of services and runs with different ending points and differing timings making the route interesting and fun - its a bit like LIRR in that respect
* The flange squeals, frog, crossing and track joint noises are awesome - might wish them to be a tiny bit louder in the cab but I can live with it as is
* The wet textures on the platforms are really good all through the line
* The scenery is nicely modelled lineside and there is enough distant to get you to glance at it - you're restricted from flying high enough to get a good look though
* The tutorial is the first one I've seen with changing ends - this I like - great for new players
* The train sounds nice
* You can nearly do a guard's mode with an AI driver (prompted by David one of my stream viewers this morning) - you can kind of make it work or at least pretend its working.

Things I don't like
* Nothing really - there are a few spots here and there where the underlying default texture shows through but its only noticeable because I went looking for it - had I not looked deliberately I never would have seen it

The train is done very nicely and so is the room for the most part a fair few services to do, but we could really do with some AI trains again. As Glasgow has this massive station but seems void of life for the most part.

You do get a few reds on the timetable which is nice but the route does feel short as it should be as it's 20/22 miles.

The electronic plyons that run for the overhead cable loading in is awful as it loads in not very far from the train.

As mentioned the route done mostly decent but you get bored very easy, need more AI trains and a bit more life on the route as usual station s are very quiet. It's an improvement on what they released for the Hamburg German route.

Pros:
. Another tube to use on the Bakerloo Line with additional services and scenarios, too. Sadly, that's pretty much it!

Cons:
. AI doesn't shut off headlights at terminus stations, causing both ends of AI operated tubes to have their headlights on.
. Apparently the 1938 Stock is used for heritage rail (in TSW 2, at least); however, much like Diesel Legends, there are two separate timetables and they can't be operated alongside the 1972 Stock (with the exception of a scenario).
. Saloon lights don't turn off, and pressing ""off"" makes them brighter. Once brighter, they can't be dimmed no matter what you press.
. The ""ride as a passenger for 20 miles"" achievement is so buggy. I've sat still for the entire length of the line several times and only gathered 13 miles.
. No physical horn/whistle button present (at least not to my knowledge).
. If using a keyboard, the instrument and cab light buttons (""I"" and ""L"") have to be pressed several times to activate and shutoff because it was programmed to both press the ""on"" and ""off"" buttons at once.

Sound design is all over the place. Im not sure quite what is going on with this but if you have any form of surround sound, it seems to be coming from all the wrong directions.. And yes. I have tried it with standard headphones as well and its just all wrong

The horn is behind the driver???
the breaks  seem to make a sound on the left hand side only
I'm not even sure what the air compressors are doing but they seem to be having some sort of seizure.
And the general ambient soundscape is just.. unfortunately lacking and hollow.

Oh.. and.. wheel noise? Does that not exist?

Controls are a little.. strange.
The activation point (user interaction zone) on the break doesn't work on the handle, but on the very end of the bar. (They got the regulator correct) So if you go to enable it it can be a prat to find.

Basically non of the switches are enabled. Would have loved to have a trip-cock failure in a scenario.. but that's not going to happen. because it isn't even activate-able.


The whistle doesn't seem to have a physical action that i have been able to find.

Visually though, the rolling stock is bang on. The lighting is excellent. The fine details are absolutely gorgeous.
But this game isn't just about looking pretty. Its about immersion. And sadly they have had a swing and a miss on that front

The 1938 stock of Bakerloo line is well made in the game.
I do recommend it, however it isn't really worth the money.

Pros:
-Extremely detailed exterior, very good model
-Interior is decent, also most of the buttons are operating.
-Easy to learn mechanics
-Has many new timetables and scenarios
-More fun introduced to the basic Bakerloo Line

Cons:
-The sounds are very quiet, not like older trains were. It sounds way too similar to the 72 stock...
-1 of the cabins can't be sat on in passenger mode.
-Randomly crashes if I switch too many switches at a time

In short:
I do recommend it when it's on sale, otherwise it's a bit too buggy and can crash without you knowing why. If you LOVE the tube, you MUST get it. If you don't like the tube that much but are bored of the basic trains, get it while it's on sale! That's what I did and I'm happy with the addon.

Although i´ve never ridden in one of those railcars it´s hard to believe they do not make any noise while coasting along. 2.) The (audible) interruptions in the electric power supply: Although in reallity there might be some gaps in the supply (e.g. when passing several switches in short distance to each other) it seems to me that the simulation is based on the principle, that every motorcar has its own ISOLATED power supply by its own contact shoe, and not in form of a common supply (if ANY contact shoe has contact, ALL motors provide power). Is this according to the real model? The simulation of the 1972 stock car doesn´t show (this amount of) gaps.

Probably one of the most interesting German routes. A lot of interesting content, although so far I have only traveled the entire route once. Along with the route, we get the BR 143 locomotive, which also jumps on the Koeln, Main Spessart or Duisburg-Bochum route.

One of the positive surprises after the talent course - finally I came across a busy line and the need to wait for the free lane signal. Such an event in the timetable significantly increases the realism. It would be a dream to hear, for example, announcements of trainstation, etc. behind your back.

Pros:
- a lot of people at the stops;
- changes of lights on the route, it is not that we always have a green light;
- good lighting (some routes such as Duisburg or Main Spessart have a kicked up night light, which makes it look very bad visually)
- The route itself is interesting, there are many intersections, junctions, straight, forest and urban sections, many stops along the route, interesting scenery (although there are places where the level of the environment is quite poor, and there are places that take your breath away - maybe the creator lacked determination, but it is a mega detail, without affecting the whole thing :));
-more than one ""branch"" on the route;
Minuses:
- Noticeably slightly worse performance than other maps;
- The route to the airport is a little disappointment, line S2 have 7 min and and is only a part of this route. I hope it will change someday


However, in the end, I highly recommend it 9/10. 
May the next addons be at this level and I very much hope that there will be a diesel multiple unit


[PL]Chyba jedna z najciekawszych tras niemieckich. Sporo ciekawej zawartości, choć póki co dopiero raz przejechałem całą trasę. Wraz z trasą dostajemy lokomotywę BR 143, która wskakuje też na trase Koeln, Main Spessart czy Duisburg-Bochum. 

Jedno z pozytywnych zaskoczeń po kursie talentem - w końcu natrafiłem na zajęta linię i konieczność oczekiwania na sygnał wolnego toru. Taki event w kursie rozkładowym znacząco zwiększa realizm. Marzeniem byłoby jeszcze kiedyś słyszeć za plecami np. zapowiedzi przystanków itp. 

Plusy:
- dużo ludzi na przystankach;
- zmiany świateł na trasie, nie jest tak że mamy zawsze zielone światło;
- dobre oświetlenie (część tras jak Duisburg, czy Main Spessart mają skopane światło nocne przez co bardzo kiepsko to wizualnie wygląda)
- Sama trasa jest ciekawa, jest sporo skrzyżowań, rozjazdów, są odcinki proste, leśne, zurbanizowane, sporo przystanków na trasie, ciekawa sceneria (choć są miejsca gdzie poziom otoczenia jest dość ubogi, a są takie które zapierają dech - może twórcą zabrakło determinacji, ale to mega detal, bez wpływu na całość :)) ;
-więcej niż jedna ""gałąź"" na trasie;
Minusy:
-Zauważalnie trochę gorsza wydajność od innych map;
-Dużym rozczarowaniem jest dziwna linia S2 do lotniska gdzie okazuje się, że to tylko ogryzek całej trasy;

Ostatecznie bardzo polecam te trasę :).

616,1490115,"Time to write e review for this route.
Positive:

- Scenery is well done in general. It looks nice
- Improved lighting adds a lot to the atmosphere of the route
- Large variety in gameplay, from ICE to shunting with the BR363
- Gnome painting and picking up graffitty spray cans.

Negative:
- A large number of issues with gameplay, some just happen for journey mode, others for the timetable as well. 
- Not enough time to setup a drive properly. This really is annoying. Whay can't we get just 2-3 minutes to setup the train properly before departure time?
- No manual, which is really needed to explain the signalling

- The scenery of the DLC looks very good, especially during the night. engine upgrade, it should  be easier to optimise it

638,1490115,"Quite fun dlc. I don't know a lot about trains and how they should sound and all, it's just a relaxing game for me. But there are a train-load of issues, it's infuriating.

The AI randomly broke for a friend when he was playing a timetable service, where it would just block the path. Kinda sounds like a feature but restarting the service wouldn't help and taking over the train would lead you down the wrong track.

I'm not sure how accurate the other stations are, but Dresden Hbf is not entirely accurate as of now. Stairs and Lifts are at the wrong position. Some store fronts would have been nice. 

It's a bit confusing when the HUD tells you there is a speed limit up ahead and it just does nothing. Maybe normal, I don't know.  

The game incourages you to explore the map to find hidden tasks. Might seem like a good idea (and it is) but my god it is unbelievable what kind of things you find:
- floating tracks and power poles
- confusingly placed invisible walls you can go around
- some objects don't have collision (cars, fences)
-  sometimes you sink into the ground or track when you are walking
- there was a group of people ""hidden"" behind a house, which you can see from the station

I love exploring maps and this just really sucks, especially when the game encourages you to keep an eye out. You don't even need to get out of the train. You can literally see when you're driving over a section that just floats over the ground. 

And I still don't know why ""retard d environ"" has an approximate delay of over 1000 minutes.

640,1490115,"Sorry, it's a negative !
Why ???

- Game and fun breaking bugs that are not of the type I can imagine being difficult to detect and solve.
-  Just very ""obvious and reproducible"" !
 - And the most frustrating: ""bugs that DTG just never seriously bothers to tackle"" !

Specific to this DLC:
- Today I thought let's try a scenario, so I choose the 3th one called ""Follow the leader"". Had  PZB turned on and guess what:
Coming up to the first station (Piestewitx) a signal (""Vorsignal"") announced a speed reduction to 60 (from 100). I started slowing down at the moment I saw the amber signal ahead. Was already under 85 when passing the signal and pressed ""PZB acknowledge"", which was confirmed by an ""ACKNOWLEDGED"" message in the HUD.
But what happened; the new TSW3 HUD mechanism just kept showing ""ACKNOWLEDGE !""; i.o.w. the scenario just didn't accept my acknowledgement. (Tried this several times and also made a screenshot which captured the contradiction above .)

The same happened at every point in the scenario where I had to acknowledge, adding up to 4 ""Zwangsbremsungen"" if I remember correctly.
(And yes, I always drive with PZB on if possible, because I think it is what makes the German routes special and fun, so I don't understand why it's not always implemented either.) 

Sorry but these kind of bugs are just way to common in DLC from DTG and after today I decided to release my frustration about it and write my first ever review !

""DTG: How come that you release a DLC, have as little as 6 scenario's to test decently and still end up having this kind of crap ???""
- No matter Whatever positive things you could say (probably about a lot of your routes), I just don't think your testing-procedures are up to standard, let alone the way you handle bugs and complaints later on.

Have seen videos on Youtube where other players didn't get these problems (although they also used PZB and where comming in much hotter than I did). => This only makes me worrying more because I think it's most likely in the way you programm. (In that case it's no wonder you'll always be having enormous amounts of complaints.)

Features multiple locomotives in the route, plus multiple you can use from other routes and addons, making for a very immersive experience to German railways. Drive anything from the unique BR363, a small diesel hydraulic shunter that will add a industrial feeling to your experience, to the modern BR 442, which will really get you to the hustle and bustle of commuter traffic. Also included are doppel stock locomotive hauled regional and S-bahn services, which makes it a fun route seeing that it features EMU and Locomotive hauled services, for those who enjoy large heavy trains, or prefer light fast ones. Includes freight as well, where it has been a somewhat seldom feature in the TSW franchise, to include both freight and passenger services in one route. Upon my first look so far, I have already found a bug where passengers will merge into platforms. So otherwise, overall quality can be compared to most other TSW routes and is not really the main focus of my review. I will add though, that the city landscapes are fairly detailed, and have a realistic feeling, but don't have over the top detailing. For getting addon locomotives, such as the BR182 and BR101, you must buy the prerequisite routes required for the addons. I find this to be a very unfortunate feature, what could possibly be a attempt at a cheap cash grab. I am not a developer though, so it could be a problem relating to base files in the routes required to run the 2 locomotives. Anyways, I find it to be rather inconvenient to get routes that I don't necessarily want to buy. Overall I would certainly recommend this addon route.

719,1490119,"This review was pretty difficult, because in actuality, I've really enjoyed half of this DLC. But I do think some of you should be aware of before purchase (and perhaps with improvement, I may reconsider).

So 5 years after CSX heavy haul, the kettles finally steam into the picture. A DLC marketed as an event for DTG to respect and carefully tread the waters of proper simulation. So how does the route and the locos fair?

[b] Positives [/b] 

+ The Jubilee Locomotives are superb. It's great seeing them in all their detail and to freely move around the loco and operate. 

+ The sense of movement just feels on point. At shunting speeds, locomotives with gently clunk and clank. At high speeds though, the engine really comes alive. Tender almost violently jostle in a vertical fashion, smoke is roaring out, oil lubrication units rotate like something out of a clock mechanism. It's rare to get a sense of your engine being alive, and the Jubilee and Stanier hit the mark here.

+ An interesting variety of new stock and services for players to try out!

+ Ambitious track plans with multiple mega-sized yards, turn-around loops, flyovers, underpasses, turntables, engine sheds. 

+ Well populated routes (you'll find engine sheds rammed with standby engines waiting to be dispatched, or run back to takeover terminating services).

+ You do get the sense that DTG have been waiting a long time to do this type of content.

So um.... what went wrong?

[b] Negatives [/b] 

- The route FPS is HEAAAAAAAAVY. My PC can chomp London-Brighton fairly well, even at peak times. This is the first DLC I've owned that really took a hit. Even the tutorials and mission intros lagged so badly until you took control of the player.
In addition, there is a crazy amount of lineside stock. Don't be surprised if you find engine sheds with 30+ idle locomotives. By far the worst performing route.

- The route itself is something of a poor choice. Whilst you get ambitious running speeds and play areas, you can tell that DTG were rushed for time. Far to easy to fall through the worlds, floating bits of track, very basic Unreal engine terraforming etc.

In addition, the artistic style, and the art assets used were not doing DTG any favours. Whilst an argument is easy made for the 50s being dirty, the environment presented here just feels brown. There's no real variation in ground or grass textures, yards are often bare of line-side clutter. The textures you do see suffer from that same plastic-y quality you may have experienced from previous settings (almost like roughness maps have been given slightly too much gloss). Lighting is always on, leaving an unrealistic yellow tinge. Fashion choices of NPCs also feel slightly out of place. 

Individually some of these may sound might nitpicks, but put together, it really does become distracting, and suggests a route quality comparable to some Train Simulator Classic routes.

- LMS Stanier is almost unplayable as a train, due to the fact that braking can cause bizarre derailments. This was a KNOWN bug that DTG announced before launch. As of writing, I've consistently had 4 wild derailments with low-level braking.

Why DTG. Why why why why why... on gods earth... would you look at a bug like that... and think it's ok to ship? I'm actually furious at the person who approved it for launch. It means now that I'm extremely apprehensive about half the content in this game.

- There are some... oddities about the way DTG decided to release this steam simulation. No indications for water levels or fire mass levels, steam blowbacks not simulated, reversers seem slightly more powerful/commanding at mid-speeds than they should be? AI Fireman is not intelligent enough to steam to avoid blowing the safeties. I'm sure there are many other oddities that people will point out on these issues

- Certain wagon consists require manual vacumn discharge. No mention of it in-game, just a forum post on it. Have fun with all the bug reports on that DTG

- On closer examination, some of the model/texture work for this route is poor. Holes in locomotives (e.g. firepit), rather odd looking coal wagon fill textures, low-poly looking ejector/injector/knobs. Subjectively, I think the Jubilee has slightly harsh roughness maps (It's meant to represent a weathered look, but you lose alot of detail against the current lighting conditions. There are also historical photos to suggest that some locomotives were halfway between slightly weathered and factory clean).

- Sound cutoffs/Bad reverb at mid-speeds

- Whilst improved, particles could still look better. Low-speed chuffs look pretty poor, smoke particles clip visibly with hard surfaces. Cylinder drains also look very generic. It would be great if

a) particles blended when hitting another surface
b) Particles deflected by an object overhead had more believable physics. Think about the speed of smoke coming out of the stack, because it still has momentum... it will try to fill up the void of the container it's in. For particles, that would mean steam bounces off ceilings to the side, it may even split into smaller particles to sit can wrap around its encompassing space.
- AI Trains don't actually ""exhaust"". Rather a powered train on regulator will look like it's idle.

[b] So should you get it? [/b] 

If you're really dying for something different, yh sure... this DLC might be for you. I won't lie, steam engines are fun, and route has some unique and engaging content. It's also clear others have had some fun with this route too.

But for everything else, I would approach with caution. It's clear this package was rushed, and DTG (once again) shoot themselves in the foot at making a good impression, and it's becoming a bit frustrating... particularly with something as high-calibre as this.

720,1490119,"I would have to say this is a very nice and interesting DLC. It is unique and more interactive in my opinion than the steam routes that were available on the normal TS game. I like how it basically puts you back in time within the steam era around the 1950's on the British railway and its really neat to see your able to actually take control of steam engines and operate them and see how they were basically operated back in history. The controls can be a bit cumbersome and it took me a bit to get used to some of the controls in order to operate the steam engines. There seems like there is a lot you can do and the route does seem to be good in length wise as well. I especially enjoy and love the old 1950's scenery where you have all the factories and towns and stuff you would see if you were living during the 1950's in Britain or even learned about it in someway shape or form. The people on the platform are even dressed like during the time period as well which is a neat thing to see. The locomotives and freight and passenger carriages are very detailed. I do also like at the beginning when you first start this DLC route it kinda goes back in time with a black and white sorta film and just gives you like a brief overview of the Spirit of Steam route as well. If you like history and going back in time and operating steam engines, then I would totally recommend this DLC.",1,1654501285,0,0,110

*From a 'Murican non BR steam weeb*  YMMV


From a physics standpoint alone, the locos/trains feel nice and act in a manner in which I'd assume is ""correct"", they feel heavy and require more than ""durrr throttle make go!!"" and you must learn the quirks and how what to do and when to do it - though it's not terribly difficult, it just may take more concentration than the average tik-tok enjoyer has to give. 


They've nice enough sounds from the whistle (non quill-able) to the run, chuff and general creaks and groans (although not enough rod clanking when coasting) and steam leaking from various holes all over the beasts. 


Looks are where i'm kinda ...ehh
While the models look nice enough its the way they're textured and painted up - seem flat with no shading or 'depth'. Got that play-doh look to them, inside and out. Were this done bc of late gen consoles? Probably. Who knows. It could've been better though. Anywho, the steam and smoke look a bit weird as well, a serious defined outline between the particles and the world as well as the color and lack of thick/thinness - these things have never been great in TSW1/2.


There are plenty of services for the Jub with stoppers, semi express and named expresses (cant recall atm the names) as well as a few yard moves.
The 8F has plenty of services as well although a bit bland just ""way freight"" and pass throughs, no working yards or industries which is a bit ridiculous as there are literally HUNDREDS of spurs and rail served industry (ok maybe not hundreds, maybe like 99) - toral waste of space and opportunity and makes me wonder why the he77 they chose this massive area...


The route itself as with the average TSW route seems plainly ok - some spots were obviously tended to with detail while the other 75% of the map was not. Swaths of blank and bland areas with nuclear colored grass and weird ground textures but also the amazing looking Liverpool Lime St Stn. and its tunnel as well as a few other notable areas. Crewe is just a shame... the place is massive and a corner stone of UK railways and was just left bare. Some a.i. stock is sitting around but not near enough, which yeah fine were there more performance would suck - so how bout just choosing another locale thats not so massive?

Both locos and rolling stock seem to work great on West Somerset which is a treat, slow but hilly so a challenge nonetheless and a bajillion more times scenic than Crewe.


For DTG's 1st outing in the steam realm, it ain't all that shabby honestly. It seems to be centered in the actual experience of operating steam engines themselves (not the fire mind you, its auto-fired) and in that respect its ok. 
The next steam DLC needs to LOOK great. Then giive it good sounds, play-ability and physics and you've got yourself a well rounded product.

722,1490119,"So for one of the most highly anticipated DLC releases in the 5 years this game has been a thing, I must say this is very disappointing. It is obvious this has been rushed, and i do feel for bossman as we all know from TS classic that his stuff is beyond insane in terms of quality and features. Really we should have come to expect DTG to throw out a half finished project but this really has shot them in the foot. A good example is the route itself, the linesides look bare. There really isn't a lot going on as your flying along. Stations look bare again with not a great deal of detail. Another glaring issue I've seen is that speed signs are non existent which when you want to drive with the HUD off, you literally have no idea when to slow down for a speed limit and so on. The HUD in this game isn't all that appealing either so being unable to play without it is just another letdown. 

To start with the locos, the models are spot on but the textures and lighting really let them down. They just look plastic and drab and compared again to stuff from TS classic, it really doesn't look good. Even the simulation of the locos feel off, 10 car train behind a jubilee and we're at 10mph in 10 seconds from 15% regulator? It should barley be moving with that load behind it. Then we get to the auto fireman and my god what a shambles. The animations for the fireman are not to be desired, they are janky and do not transition smoothly into each other. The firebox door even closes before the fireman has had chance to throw the coal into the firebox. It seems there is no proper boiler simulation as the water level doesn't even do anything. It just seems pointless putting all this effort in to release a half-arsed, half finished DLC. I could go on and on but i feel i'd just be wasting my time.

To finish up - If you guys want a proper simulation, one that feels close or similar to the real thing then don't buy this. It isn't worth the money. TSW is actually dire considering it was meant to be the future of train simulation and TS classic is still head and shoulders above it in terms of what you can do and realism. (and the majority of the 3rd party content isn't rushed and littered with detail). I just don't understand how the guys over at DTG thought yeah this is okay. I would rather wait a year for something top quality and worth the money, than spend £24.99 (which btw is about the same as the game itself costs) on something that was rushed out just to keep the cash flowing. The more we stop buying this crap the sooner they will realise we want quality over quantity and that they really need to up their game.",0,1654653624,0,0,4
723,1490119,"My feedback so far after playing some tutorials and a service.

1)The route itself is fantastic, the details are great and it all looks really nice.

2) The new introduction is great, short and to the point, a nice way to get introduced to the route.

3) The tutorials are really good, if you new to steam, they will teach you everything you need to know to get going, really nice.

4) The sounds are somewhat good, the footplate experience on the whole is not great, the chuffing sounds are too soft, it sounds as though you way in the distance. There are no regulator movement sounds, when you open and close the regulator, you should hear linkages and what not, there is nothing here. I was not getting any breaking application sounds either. When you apply and release the breaks, you hear no steam sounds. 

5) There is no delay when opening the regulator and the steam chest filling with steam. In reality, when you open the regulator, there is a delay until you start seeing a build up in steam pressure, on TSW, its instant.

6) Lack of AI. The route feels as though there has just been an apocalypse, there is next to no traffic.

7) The fireman animations are fantastic, really nicely done. Would be nice if the fireman would stop what they are doing and start shovelling when you open the firebox door, and if it could continue to do so until you close the door. (This is in manual mode that I am referring to)

8) No climbing animations when you climb onto the footplate. I really do feel like this is an immersion killer as this instant hop into the cab is very jarring. 

If you have never been on the footplate of a steam locomotive, this DLC will be fantastic for you, however, if like me, you have experience being on a footplate of a real steam loco, this will be extremely disappointing. I really wanted to love this DLC and I really do want to love this DLC, but the locos on here are a real let down for me and i'm really disappointed.",0,1654029532,0,0,39
724,1490119,"This review is based on alimited amount of gameplay. I did three tutorials and three services. Also I visited a number of stations on foot.

The route is set in 1958, in the decline of steam (steam disappeared from this route in 1962). It is not a very long route, but it has three huge yards along the way and a huge number of facilities for steam engines and rolling stock. Also the clutter is adapted to the era, wooden crates, old suitcases, remainders of steam engines and so on. Some of the sheds have a somewhat limite interior, which is great.

Passengers area adapted to era. They were forced to give up their mobile phones :-(. Unfortunately no rush our passenger densities yet.

Signalling is a mix of impressive semaphore sigals and fewer of the first generations light signals. The route represents the transition. You may see some disused semaphore signals. 

You will see a lot of signal boxes (70 in total). These were created in a modular fashion which reduced to cost a bit but also helps with game performance. Each individual signal box is different. You should try getting near one of them and check if they implemented sound as well (they did for WSR).

Rolling stock, the 8F freight engine and the Jubilee express train. Mk1 coaches and a nice assortment of freight wagons, even unfitted 16? ton coal vans to increase the braking fun.

DTG developed a completely new simulation for the physics. If you really want, you can fire the engine manually but it is not well supprted yet. DTG aims to further develop manual firing in near future (no release date given). Afterwards the automaic firing will be refined as well.

I should also mention that DTG solved the motion blur issue. Unreal engine does not support rotational motion blur, because in most games nobody will notice that wheels are not really turing. But the big spoke wheels look bad with the traditional motion blur. This is solved now, so turn motion blur on (using the settings or F2)..

For both engines new sound recordings are used and a lot of effort was put into this.

All these are things I like a lot, but nothing is perfect:

First thing is the choice of this route. This was not the most brilliant idea. We really miss shunting engines and shunting services. It feels a bit of a waste. With only two engines this busy route feels empty. Let's hope soon additional DLC will be created to fill the gap, but my guess is that DTG will first solve the issues with the simulation.

My seconod critisim is the lack of a manual. There are some videos explaining things, but the explanation speed is far to high, Personally I prefer a manual where I can read things (I will create one on short notice for you).

There are some smaller issues like an invisible fireman in the tutorials, track joint sound is not audible, excessive blowing the safety valve. These issues probably will be solved soon. I also saw Mary Poppins fly over the flower plants at one of the stations, but they did not give her an umbrella, which is an immersion breaking issue.

If you read my reviews, you may know the verdict ""Do you recommend this game"" means for me, Yes, run to the store and get it, you really should spend your money on this. In most cases I do not do not recommend DLC, even though they are quite OK. 

In this case, I may be a bit biased because I really love steam and railway history. Despite the issues, I recommend this. Get it right away if you can afford it, otherwise wait for a discount and get it then.

If you claim, you don't like steam,you are so wrong. The steam era was the absolute top in railway history and tachnology is so visible!

725,1490119,"Ever since I was 8 years old playing Microsoft Train Simulator, I have dreamed of a train simulation game that was open world where I could hop on any steam loco and drive or ride, or just walk around the station or yard. I saw the potential for this dream of mine since the release of CSX Heavy Haul, and I have been sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for steam locomotives to come to TSW. After waiting patiently for many years, I must say that I am not disappointed. The release of Spirit of Steam (SoS) has been a dream come true for me. I cannot simply get enough of driving these steam locos across this route. 

Is It Worth the Money?
Pros:
Setting aside my passion for this content, SoS is probably one of the best value for money routes in TSW2. For $30 USD, It comes with 2 new locomotives, almost all new rolling stock (The only ""recycled"" piece of rolling stock is the 12t Van from the BR heavy freight pack), new 1950s UK scenery assets, and a semi-decent length route with several large yards. It includes 6 scenarios, including one Edge Hill Yard free roam, over 130 services (36 for the 8F and 99 for the Jubilee)  with a nice variety of services for both locos. With this amount of content, there are many hours of game play for SoS with lots of potential for custom scenarios in off the rails mode. 
Cons:
Three downsides to SoS IMO is the lack of traffic, the lack of manual firing of the locomotives, and the bugs. When driving a service along the entire route, I have not encountered a lot of traffic along the way. Also, when you pull into Crewe or Liverpool, most of the time your train is the only one in the station. I believe the main reason for this is the other services during this time on this route would have been done by other locomotives that are not in SoS. This does leave room for additional DLC locos to come to SoS, but it does leave it somewhat empty. I always enjoyed the challenge of driving and firing steam locos in TS (Especially the advanced ones by Meshtools and Victory Works). Not seeing this in SoS is disappointing, but according to DTG, it will come eventually to the game. Now, time for the important question:

How Bad are the Bugs?

DTG is notorious for releasing content with bugs, and like most other of their releases, there are several bugs that I have encountered:
-The fireman/woman loves to disappear or not appear at all
-The 8F derails fairly easy if you apply the brakes too fast
-For some of the 8F services where you pick up wagons at Edge Hill, the rear wagons sometimes spawn behind the bumpers, so when you couple up to them, your entire train explodes
-There is at least one service for the 8F that goes out of bounds so you cannot complete it
-The Jubilee's headlamp is usually red
- (This is sort of a bug, it's realistic, just poor marshaling) The vacuum brake equipped wagons between unfitted cars must be manually released in order for the train to move
These are just some of the bugs that I have encountered, I am sure there are more that other players have experienced. DTG is aware of many of these bugs and plans to fix some of the them in the next patch. So, if any of these bugs may irritate you, you may want to hold off on SoS for a bit until these bugs are patched.

Final Thoughts

IMO SoS is the best DLC for TSW to release to date despite the bugs. Obviously, I am completely biased since this is a dream come true for me, but just being able to completely immerse yourself in the 1950s driving, riding, and watching steam locos is just an incredible experience. SoS is a must buy if you love steam locos. I hope that DTG and/or other 3rd party devs that have released excellent steam content for TS **cough** Meshtools **cough** will release more steam locos to fill out the timetable for this route. I absolute love SoS and cannot wait to see the future for steam locomotives in TSW2.

733,1490119,"I am utterly gutted that after two years of work (and maybe more), that the Spirit of Steam project has completely failed to launch as a working piece of software.  The developer (DTG) has had a new QA Director in place for months, and yet this DLC has still been released in a shocking state - either as a late alpha (key features undeveloped) or an early beta (key features and broad content generally untested and generally not subjected to sufficient QA).

The concept of this DLC is warmly welcomed, but it needs months more development work before DTG can begin to think about selling it for £25 or $30/€30....!  You will probably need to wait at least a year for the major issues to be properly addressed, so wait until at least June 2023 before thinking about buying.... at which point you will also be paying a more reasonable price, probably ""discounted"" by about 60% to 70%.

This is what you will experience in your first hour of your ""Journey"" on this DLC:

- in the Introduction you will see some very nicely modelled trains (they are truly wonderful looking models), including a fabulous first class interior on a MkI coach...... but then you take control.....:
- but there is no manual (the DLC has not been completed to specification, so they can't write a manual....), so you are on your own with your steam trains....;
- in the first service, if you try to stop your freight train with even a minimal amount of braking effort when going downhill, even when you have slowed to 1 mph, your freight train will derail and the engine will turn over (the physics for the combination brake is broken);
- in the second service you cannot start your freight train because the consist includes fitted wagons that have vacuum brakes locked on and situated between unfitted wagons, so you cannot control the brake pipe for the fitted wagons from the loco (this would have been found in testing if they had tested the gameplay for less than one hour....!);
- when the locomotives are at a stand the fireman/woman will constantly keep the fire super-hot so that the emergency pressure/safety valve is constantly on and utterly deafening, although he/she does this with a shovel that has invisible coal on it;
- the full manual firing simulation has not yet been developed (water management is supposedly planned for some future update...), although this is fundamental to a steam train simulation (and present in 2013's Train Simulator)...;
- the safety valve will obliterate the rest of the audio (chuffing, etc.) most of the time you are running and there is nothing much that you can do about it, and in the first 'rescue' scenario even the dead-in-tow loco has the same problem for the whole run;
- if you are not careful the fireman/woman will suddenly appear coincident with your avatar, with collision on, and you will be thrown from the footplate - if this happens when the train is moving you will lose control of the train;
- when you do get moving and maybe have brief respite from the safety valve for a minute or two, you will realise that the train makes no sound over any track joints and there is no reverberation from walls/tunnels/bridge supports (which is something you do get in the 2013 version of Train Simulator...);
- the physics on the 6P Jubilee passenger train with a rake of MkI coaches is a joke, it's like a MagLev on acceleration... maybe they used the London Commuter Electrostar EMU physics as a baseline... (the 8F with a mixed rake of loaded wagons is pretty good though);
- there are hardly any other trains around, including around Crewe station (in 1958 - maybe there was a pandemic that year...?), but there is still a chance that somewhere on the map a badly scheduled AI (or something else unseen) will cause a SPAD which will end your game without warning;
- although the route scenery is generally quite attractive, it is very poorly optimised with memory being swallowed up by scripted track that appears on the map widget but can't actually be used (yet...?);
- on my PC (well beyond the recommended spec for TSW 2), any interaction with a train control (HUD widget) results in a long freezing studder (up to about a second), and this happens everywhere on the route - the memory is that badly stacked;
- some of the builds (such as over-bridges) have very poor texture work, so that you can see the stitching between the prims, and some flooring has no collision so you can fall through the map's ground.

This is a DLC that DTG says it is ""proud of"", yet they couldn't even be bothered to play-test their unfinished release candidate for this DLC for just one hour - because all of the above problems are immediately obvious in the first hour of play.

The safety valve issue alone makes the DLC largely unplayable - unbearably so.  You can, of course, mute all of the audio and play the DLC in silence...  Taking screenshots around Runcorn with a UE4 sunrise (with audio muted) is about the only positive experience available on the route, although even that will be spoiled by the jet of steam blowing out of the safety valve, so even your screensaver images will serve to remind you of the terrible time you had with this DLC.

NB: It is even worse if you are on XBox or PlayStation.  The lack of optimisation on XBox means that some players are having random crashes (on a console...!), and of course there is no headroom or priority to fully play sound, so many sound loops get jack-hammered.  On PlayStation, nobody has checked (as usual) to see if the final build has problems with LoD (detail level) or poly count/priority (which are handled differently on PS when cooking from UE4), so those players can't even see much of the loco cab controls or much of the scenery.

It's a total disgrace.

This is a DLC where DTG genuinely had a chance to shine, and to show off the undoubted skills of their artists.  But yet again, the poor production, co-ordination and management of many talented people, the lack of testing and the rush to release an unfinished product has spoiled the show.

Avoid this DLC until it is completed and been tested and shown to work... sometime towards the end of 2023.... or maybe 2024....",0,1654190442,0,0,11
734,1490119,"I am sure you've seen a million Steam reviews that bemoan the lack of a neutral button, and I hate to pile on, but Spirit of Steam is one such release that is just too complicated to boil down to a binary. However, I did in fact complete the entire journey mode and I believe that gives me some authority on the subject. This will be largely the same as my review of the TSW3 version of the route, but with some minor differences that ultimately changed my final score.

First I want to mention the steam locomotives themselves which are the least controversial part of this release. They are beautiful. They sound pretty darn good. They are fun to run and they really give you the sensation of being in the cab of one of the most amazing marvels of human ingenuity. Steam engines are my favorite thing about train simulators and the existence of this route makes it difficult for me to go back to Train Simulator Classic. My only gripes are the lack of a manual firing option and the lack of engine variety. To that first point, this really just means your fire mass and water level are always maxed out, so you can set your firing to assisted or manual to turn off the fireman constantly shoveling coal and all you are left with is the safeties blowing while you're at a stop. To the second point, it is somewhat baffling that the route didn't come with a mixed traffic engine like the Black 5 for freight and passenger services and a tank engine like the Jinty for shunting. The Jubilee and the 8F are really rather similar locomotives in look and feel, and this problem would've been so easily solved with some smarter decision making here.

I have somewhat less glowing thoughts on the the route, Liverpool Lime Street to Crewe. It is fun running the route. The grade changes are fun to navigate and the nature of steam engines means that every little thing that you might take for granted in the other routes can be a fun and gratifying challenge. I like the scenarios and there are some fun timetable services that shake things up like shunting services or the caboose tour. On the other hand, the journey mode is just not very good. It starts off pretty solid but at some point it's just pointlessly gating you from the scenarios by having you do the same 50ish minute service in the Jubilee back and forth repeatedly for no apparent purpose. Unfortunately, the route is also incredibly sparsely detailed and DTG has made the bizarre and blatantly dishonest excuse that this is just what the route looked like in real life at the time. That is obviously not the case and the giant empty fields even on ultra foliage are distracting in a game that can be just as much about the scenery as the gameplay. All of this is not helped by the lack of lights on the route which makes running at night a terrible experience. You literally cannot see anything. The timetable is similarly sparse and it often feels as though you are the only train on the route at any given time.

Finally, I have to mention the pervasive bugs and glitches that remain in this dlc almost a year after its release. Firstly, despite the poor route detail, it also runs very poorly with massive framedrops near any of the route's railyards. There are also SPAD service failures that occur as a result of AI trains passing red signals (this can be circumvented by moving fast enough that the AI train unloads before passing the signal). Although the shunting services are good fun, several of them spawn freight cars inside of each other and over buffers, making completing most of them impossible. There are also at least one scenario and one timetable service in which acquiring a gold rank is impossible. There may be more than this but these are the ones that most impacted my time with the route. DTG has promised to address these issues in the future but with the existence of TSW3 it raises a lot of questions as to whether these problems will be addressed in *this* version, not just the current platform. The same goes for manual firing. Even if DTG assures us they will, they have lied so frequently in the past that consumer trust is rightfully totally eroded and I can't recommend anyone take them at their word.

Overall there is a host of issues that make this package so much less than it could have been but I would be lying if I didn't say I got my money's worth just running the steamers up and down the grades. If you are a steam enthusiast like me, you will still get a lot out of this route. If you have never tried steam in a train simulator before I think most will find it a fun and interesting challenge. However, I ultimately cannot recommend you purchase this version of the route because of the lack of certainty as to the future of bug fixes for TSW2. I can only recommend purchasing this route if you are absolutely certain you will never buy TSW3 and are alright with absolutely none of the concerns raised in this review ever being addressed.",0,1680488096,0,0,71

I don't know why but the steam locos look better in TSW2 than in TSW3, especially the smoke and steam effects are mediocre and certainly not better than in TS Classic, which is surprising to me. In TSW3 even worse than in TSW2 btw (same graphics settings) and imo almost pathetic (like cigarette smoke almost) for such a 'higher end' simulator compared with TS Classic. No blackening smoke effects when stoking etc.  It confirms to me that TSW as a whole is still performing below expectations. Also still VERY confusing handling of the menus etc, finding what you are looking for and NO manuals whatsoever.

Will they ever fix it we will have to wait and see.

My first hour with this DLC was simply could not get the loco to move then finding out it's a wagon brake issue.

-- the countryside and the urban environments, realistically portraited;
-- the engines? Every knob, valve, meter are working fine;
-- the motion blur, once ruining the wheels animation, now finally works perfectly, leaving the complex steam locomotives contraptions in their full magnificence.

739,1490119,"Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss I know I said I would not buy another route from this company, and I really intended to keep that promise too because this company is scum that exploits it's fans, but like many others I was always interested in the prospect of steam in train sim world, So I waited for it to release and for some reviews to come up before buying, they had a chance to really nail a steam experience here, and I hate to say it but I think they have done it right. . .

I'm not an expert on steam trains so I'm not an authority on how they should look or sound but everything I did in this route was a very interesting experience, the aspects of driving a steam train has been simulated pretty good here (as far as I'm aware) and driving them is a severely bad day for you if your not ready for it, since they are such different beasts to regular diesels and electrics, they require a different driving style and for that it's a fun change up to game play, I still don't understand why it took them so long to make this though, it doesn't seem like that much went into it.

the noises again I'm not an authority on but I felt like it was a real, living breathing locomotive the entire time, every sound seemed pretty accurate, every creak and groan betraying weight and every hiss portraying pressure ready to explode if not managed right, I cannot have any complaints about sound here as I felt immersed the entire time.

the graphics as usual are Dovetails usual half flawed half amazing train sim world standard, some of the scenery was atrocious some of it was really good, the steam train model was really good though, I enjoyed watching this train in action as I drove along, every animation was on point (again as far as I'm aware) and gave it the sense of power and movement.

I've heard complaints of bugs and lag issues, the first one I haven't encountered any bugs myself but it would be bad to discredit these claims because I haven't played everything so read other reviews and take what I say with a pinch of salt, I haven't encountered any bugs yet and I've played a good variety of services, as for the lag issues. . .well I haven't really had any lag everything runs at the usual dovetail ultra settings 36FPS for me but I do run a 9900k and 2080 super so I can't speak for any other lower end system, I did encounter some bugs though, one was a mans head sticking out of the carriage at one point on the route, hundreds of clipping points even in the steam train cab (the door for instance) platform clipping and so on.

this route was a surprisingly good route, there are the usual signs of dovetail laziness that everyone has (wrongfully so) come to expect now but other then that I think this is a really good route, I'm still not gonna buy another one, I gave this a chance, it worked out, but knowing DTG the next route will be a flop riding off the success of this one.

742,1490119,"I'm very happy with this.  This is the best Steam Train sim you can buy today, so if you're into that, it's great. That said, it's a train sim and that means it's not for everyone, not nearly.   Most people will hate this.  You can't steer!  There's no explosions!  You don't run a train company.  You don't sell cargo.  You don't even have rewarding crashes.  Instead you pull levers and twist knobs and make chuffing noises and roll down the line.  If that appeals to you, this is your thing.

So, I get to drive steam engines on my computer, in 4k, with realistic chuffing sounds. That's what I want, and that's what I got.  Happy day.

I've read some of the negative reviews and I just shrug. I'm not a person who will have an opinion on how quickly vacuum pressure should drop when braking, nor do I care. I don't honestly think I'd have more fun if that vacuum pressure dropped faster or slower, it would just be different. Someone out there would care, and presumably be more entertained, but not me.  Similarly, I've also not operated a real steam locomotive, nor would I expect the experience of playing this DLC on my computer in my office to compare with actually running a locomotive out in the world. Frankly I think that's just silly.  

So, what do you get?  You get sights and sounds of Steam trains, new mechanics that are fun and take some learning yet also not incomprehensible. That's what this DLC promises, and it delivers. 

In about 5 hours of play on this DLC I've only had one serious bug, which has prompted me to start saving my game more then I would like thereafter.   I also found a place in one of the yards, near a signal tower, where I got stuck.  I'd rate that as better then average for DTG. Given their history, it's not unreasonable to expect these things to be fixed in patches.  

For those of you upset that everything is not perfect on day one, I feel you are mistaking this very niche product for the next FIFA or Zelda game. This is not that.  This is a steam train simulator. Built by a small team for a small audience on a  small budget. The people who make stuff like this do so because they are into it. They are not ""lazy"", they are resource constrained. QA for a PC product is notoriously hard, there's a bazillion configurations out there and this is not a linear product, and it's a DLC within a larger ecosystem.  In development terms, it's hard to make. With infinite QA resources they could find everything and with infinite dev resources they could then fix everything, but they would go bankrupt first because this is niche and resources are not infinite. Instead they get it stable, fix what they can and release it into the wild and then triage all known issues as they get feedback to make the best thing within their budget.  This is how games work when you're not a flagship product.   Reality sucks.

I'm look forward to additional steam content, hopefully next up is the Riviera Line and some stuff for GWR fans like me.  Sorry for the rant above, but I really hate the negativity directed at DTG, they're making something small for a passionate community who's relentlessly critical.  This DLC is the best thing they've done, IMO.",1,1654134128,0,0,8
743,1490119,"Being a long-time 'rail nerd' since the MSTS days, I can definitely see the little 'gems' in this DLC. The big one (for me) being the ultra-realistic modelling and simulation of the steam cylinder/chest pressure. Case in point, stop the loco, apply the brakes fully. Now apply a slight amount of regulator with the cylinder drains closed. Watch the steam chest pressure begin to rise. Close the regulator. Watch as the steam chest remains pressurised. Now release the brakes (regulator still closed), and watch as the loco begins to move forward with the residual steam chest pressure that was still accumulated in the chest. 

It's the little things folks! 😅

But otherwise, I really enjoy the cab/loco swaying and shaking as it moves down the rails too. Very realistic. Other things I enjoy are the detail on the Liverpool Lime Street/Crewe route that's included in this DLC. 

Now the not-so-great things (at time of this writing):

* No water injection/water management is modelled at present
* Coal shovelling and firebox management does little (nothing?) to affect the boiler pressure at present. I can run entire scenarios/timetables without even so much as shovelling one load of coal, and boiler pressure holds-up just fine. 

Hopefully the apparently-upcoming 'Fireman' update for this DLC will address the above points though. I hope it does because imo, SoS will then become the most realistic simulation of steam locomotives.

Tip: the greatest factor in determining your steam generator rate at present is the dampers setting! The front and rear damper levers on the floor by the fireman's shovel. Keep the dampers low or even closed for the most part if you're on a milk run, and you'll find the boiler pressure won't be so obnoxiously high to the point it blows-off the relief valve. For the more hilly and challenging runs, open-up the dampers as needed.

Whilst the addition of steam locomotives in their heyday is a new and interesting experience for TSW the driving has left me rather unsatisfied. In comparison to Train Simulator Classic, the driving experience is no where near as rewarding as it is on TSC. In TSC you have to constantly be checking your regulator to makes sure it isn't open too much otherwise you'll find you won't be going very fast, whereas in TSW you just put in fully and off you go.

As important of a milestone the addition of steam locomotives to TSW2 is, you would think the company would ensure the most glaring bugs were worked out.  Without other paying customers who end up becoming dedicated troubleshooters, some scenarios would be unplayable.  

The few scenarios that I got through so far were created with pretty much no creativity, and I do hope they improve moving forward.  There are only a certain amount of times I can drive from the same station to another close-by same station, then reversing to the same or very similar siding before I must beat my head against the wall out of boredom.

Honestly, everything feels pretty much spot on. The physics are about right for the two kettles, and there's plenty of room to get up to speed with. 

Have you ever wondered what it's like on a steam locomotive at high speed? Try the Jubilee at 80-90mph. You're bouncing around a heck of a lot, just like how it'd be in real life. Both hammer blow and track conditions mean you're rolling around a lot at speed.

There's a good mixture of freight wagons for your freight moves as well. Plenty of yard space to shunt around in. Signals all look and work good. Steam particle effects even collide with most objects! (It's not perfect collision, but it definitely does the job)

The only real letdown is the lack of possibly one of the most important locomotives for this route, and that's a Black 5. Black 5s provide the intermediary between a Jub and an 8f. Not having one feels like a missed opportunity, and also screams loco addon down the road.

Cons:
Only 2 locos makes the route feel a little empty (There should be a tank engine for short haul trips).
People are still very sub-par compared to other games. Planet Coaster does NPCs best IMO. DTG could do a lot to implement a system more like that. 
The world feels pretty dead, not enough ambient sounds, animated objects, cars, poepel moving about, etc...
Does not add steam scenarios to other routes like WSR, NTP, etc...
Some sound balancing isn't right, they seem to be scared to make the trains as loud as they are in real life compared to other noises.
No hard mode with more difficult scoring criteria for services.

It has its issues but is a great first step into getting this tech into the game and the 18+months of development into the route and locomotives can be seen, with small details making a lasting impression, although there are some minor issues at launch which I hope will see some improvements. 

Locomotives (Jubilee & 8F):

•	Both look and sound great! Steam particles also look great with no FPS impact. Physics appear realistic and the fireman’s animations are a great addition. 

•	The negative points include the lack of a full firing feature, with complete manual firing being disabled at launch such as water level being set, unchanging and injectors disabled. I hope this is added soon after it has been worked on some more, but still a shame to see missing.

•	AI trains appear to currently (most of the time) lack sounds and effects such as exhaust effects and chuffing sounds when accelerating. This does break immersion and again hopefully fixed. 

The Route (Liverpool Lime Street to Crewe):

•	Route is a nice length at 36 Miles, It feels atmospheric which fits the 1958 time period with some nice details such appropriately dressed passengers and large yards with good amount of scenic rolling stock, although these large yards do reduce performance dramatically. 

•	Some parts of the route lack some scenic detail with some large spaces without much detail, but this appears to be a compromise in busy areas to maximise performance such as Runcorn and the large yard areas. 

•	Currently (known issue), track joints sounds are missing which slightly reduces the ambient running sounds. Again this is known and hopefully is corrected in a post release patch. 

•	With only 135 services the route feels abit quite for its size, this hopefully improves as further steam locomotives become available to fill in the missing services. It would be nice to see more shunting movement in the yards for example, which would be well suited to a shunting/tank engine such as a Jinty or 4MTT. 

Final Thoughts:
Do I recommend this route? Yes. Does it have the usual post release issues and bugs? Yes. This is another great route and addition to TSW2 which will hopefully receive some updates (Again hopefully in a timely manner) to improve it to be one of the best DLC’s so far. I really look forward to the future of steam and hope to see more sooner, rather than later.

 I regret buying it at full price. It will probably be amazing in a year or two when they release more content for it and patch it up.

Steam engines need careful handling and you get a flavour of the challenges from the period, from complex, sprawling yards, to partially and unfitted freight trains, where brakes have to be carefully managed. 

Plenty of period posters and road vehicles add to the immersion and small details, like traffic lights on the roads, p-way huts, canal scenes and factories. Pleased to see stations and signal boxes were not straight ""default"" structures, clearly a lot of time has been spent on research.

786,1490119,A whole load of bugs and the sound at times in certain camera positions is awful. Once these are fixed maybe it will be fine. The game and concept is great but feels like its been rushed before its ready for release. There was a point at Speke where the train runs across lines which aren't even there to stop point which is on a different line. Trying to couple on a Edge Hill game leads to the train derailing whilst it is standing still.Using turntable at Edge Hill just made the loco tip over. A number of services are too heavy to move and you can't get them going and when you can they don't have sufficient power to get far before they stop again unless you unhook half the trucks. whenever you back up to trucks don't be moving because even the slowest speeds will derail it.These sort of things happen a lot.

(I'm no expert with game development so i don't really no what i'm talking about btw)
The issue i find with the physics for Spirit of steam, is sometimes when stopping a freight train the game decides to fling your whole train either straight of the rails or to the moon.
This is obviously very painfull when your stopping your train after a long run. 
Thats the only bad thing i see with the DLC tho, deffinently recommend it if you can handle a little bit of frustrating events,

789,1490119,I have enjoyed playing this DLC and I think it brings something to the game that it needed. I'm not impressed with how the game runs. There are huge freezes while playing and the frames drop often. I'm glad they put in the fireman though. That was something that should have been in the DLC since the release but who releases finished content anymore. The route itself is good looking. I've never been to this area so I can't say how accurate it is but it's convincing. The rolling stock and locomotives are well modeled. They have great textures and look weathered. The sounds are good from what I can tell. Overall I would recommend this. It's entertaining and different from anything else in the game as of now.,1,1654813207,0,0,3
790,1490119,"Despite the large number of bugs, glitches or missing features it's pretty fun. I spent quite alot of time with the steamers to learn how to manage them with the current limitations. I want to write a positive review to encourage the devs to carry on with this project and that all the hard work is going to pay off. 

So how difficult is it to drive it? not very. It's the typical TS2022 level with some minor advanced features. Once you run through the tutorials you will have to use some logic on the management of the steamers. Keep in mind at the time of this review some features do not work as intended YET. For example it's a challenge to keep the chest pressure from going off it's nut so you gotta manipulate the steam via blower and regulator, front pipes, etc. It's all going down all at once. It's obviously the first ever attempt to re-introduce steamers into TSw2 so you will have to accept that there will be glitches, bugs, incomplete features or some broken but that's ok the developers are going to fix  them.",1,1654245683,0,0,84
791,1490119,"I can’t stop driving this route! I love the locos; the in cab experience is impressive and it is fun to lean on the whistle as I blast the express through a station. Time just slips by as I run up and down this line.

With the manual firing option, you can control everything but the water and driving becomes a challenge to maximize speed with efficient use of steam and come somewhat close to staying on time.  There is also the challenge of driving the route smoothly. If you are too aggressive at getting down to a speed limit, it could cost you for miles as you lose steam and/or speed trying to make up for it.  Best I have done so far is to be a little under 10 minutes late on an end to end run.

The rolling stock is well modelled.  I love lighting the furnace in the brake van and seeing the smoke come out of the chimney.  The coupling and brake riggings are also impressive.  As for the track noise, the sound going over points and frogs is good.  A fix for the rail joints is said to be coming in an early patch.

Just three days in, I already feel like I have gotten my investment back in enjoyment and I haven’t even  begun to fully explore the route or – and I am really looking forward to this! – take these locos on other routes with Creator’s Club scenarios.

There are some TSW locos that I really love driving; the F7, the 465, the DB 101, and the 612 come to mind.  However, it is going to be a while before I think about anything else but driving these two steamers.  Well done, DTG.  This is a great start with steam.

I think the driving experience is nicely balanced to appeal to a wide range of players and for myself just about right, so it doesn't become frustrating rather than fun. I am not sure if further development of the operation of the models would be possible so that people could choose the level of difficulty to suit their them is possible, but we shall see. There are already a lot of community liveries available to download to add some diversity and I am sure a lot more to come. The atmosphere of the route is nice and the visual and sound effects of the models to me just look and sound fantastic, but I am no expert, and I am sure there is room to tweak them to make them even better. I have not had any performance issues or come across any bugs so far and I am sure if there are any they will be fixed. I have noticed a real step change in the support by the developers in the last 6 months or so with a lot of outstanding issues getting fixed with regular patches and the quality of DLC's has improved. Dovetail seems to be taking quality much more seriously and reducing the roll out of bugged poor quality DLC every couple of weeks in favour of a more measured and pragmatic approach to the quality of the content they are releasing. This change in direction deserves praise. Now they have cracked steam using the Unreal engine I hope we can all look forward to some fantastic new routes and locomotives in the years to come.

Scenery is fine but can be a bit bland (as with anything since LGV really).

Performance is better than I expected, given I'm running with ini edits, but still subject to some big variation depending on where in the route you're looking.

There are a couple of irritations. Firstly the automatic fireman is rather over enthusiastic so the safety valve goes off far more than it should be which gets annoying. Secondly, scenery smoke will overlay the engine smoke when it should be behind it, which looks awful when it happens. Thirdly, I really feel like this route should have come with a shunter (BR black Class 08 would have made sense) for pilot services and preparing wagons in the massive railyard.",1,1654091101,0,0,9
799,1490119,"DTG did it! They brought us Steam and the technology behind it works. The particle effects look great, the sounds are fantastic and the performance is surprisingly good.

The route itself is great, not the longest but with so much variety and giant yards that make up for it. The locos and coaches are beautiful as well.

There are a number of bugs, some minor glitches, some flickering ground textures that I can live with. But so far all the tutorials and scenarios have had buggy objective markers at least once, the refueling tutorial was almost unplayable.

My the biggest criticism has to be the AI trains. There isn't a lot of AI traffic along the route but the yards are fairly busy and I could understand why they went this way. BUT there is a bug with the AI trains that not only breaks the immersion but takes one of the best parts of steam locos from the game! AI Locos that are connected to coaches don't have realistic steam output and instead look like they are constantly idling. Considering the amount of work that went into this DLC and the ongoing work on the firing system I hope this will be fixed soon, unlike what we are used to with other DLC.

There are some obvious issues that need to be addressed, such as missing coal on the fireman shovel, some services needing you to manually release the brakes and there are fewer services than one might expect due to there only being 2 locomotives and no layers.

809,1490119,"A beautifully crafted British 1958 period route with locos, depicting the commercial heartland of England and the traffic between Liverpool, one of the largest port cities in the world and Crewe, one of the largest rail interchanges. 

The railway infrastructure, landscapes and buildings are finely modelled. The viaduct and bridges over the Mersey are stunning. The lighting is particularly fine – driving in the hour after sunrise or before sunset is stunning and provides ample opportunity for some lovely screenshots. The shafts of sunlight on the smoke in the loco sheds is as atmospheric as it was in real life. I do however, question the lack of lineside fencing in the rural areas, but then again, I haven’t done the research that the developers have.

The locos, coaches and waggons are superbly modelled, the texturing is perfect and they sound wonderful. I love watching the slow motion of the coupling rods when the locos start. The only goof, for which they have a fix ready, is the lack of coal on the fireman’s shovel.

The driving experience feels super realistic with all of the drivers controls functioning as they should. The old vacuum brakes are quick to apply with an accurate, variable, deceleration curve at speed and are accurately sluggish to release - about 1 second per waggon. The locos are a lot  slower to accelerate than modern locos, which takes some getting used to and once you’ve got up to speed, it’s about maintaining it up the long inclines. I would, though, have preferred a more era appropriate HUD design, using old gauge styles, as the digital style just looks wrong.

I’m looking forward to the upcoming manual firing update, so that I can take over the responsibilities of the AI firemen, in addition to those of the driver. Single manning would never occur in real life and that is, I suspect, where the real challenge will lay.

In timetable mode, there are 36 drivable freight services for the 8F and 98 for the Jubilee, taken from the real passenger timetable. Some of them are end to end runs and some part way, until the service branches off the route. End to end express runs take about 50 minutes, which is perfect for me.

As ever, the sandbox scheduling tool allows you to quickly create your own services to run any locos and rolling stock you like, on the route. The class 08 shunter, the 40 & the 101 DMU being obvious choices, although for more realism, they’d need a livery change in the livery designer tool. In the same manner, the steam locos and coaches & waggons can be run on any other route.

Given the huge number of modern and legacy locos in service at the time on the route, I’m looking forward to the third party developers working their magic, as they did with the previous simulator. Obvious choices are 4MT large tank engines for the local passenger services, all of the LMS’s top express locos – Duchesses & Princess Royals, Jinty’s and the early LMS diesels for shunting, Black Five’s for just about everything, Super Ds and the experimental Deltic, and that's just for starters.

As for hardware requirements, it runs smoothly on high graphics settings and 30 FPS on my basic 3 year old 8Gb, Core i5, GTX 1650 4Gb, PC. It appears to require about 4Gb of RAM and loading speeds are slow, if you don’t have an SSD card.

If you’re new to both driving UK steam locos, and the signalling, developer, Dovetail Games, have created a number of in game tutorials and additionally, videos on their discussion forum. Search – Train Sim World – Announcements - Spirit Of Steam - What You Need To Know Megathread

This is a great alternative to easy to drive modern locos. Prepare to be immersed in old school Britain.

[h2]Story[/h2]

Bambooblade's one and only mission in this game is to climb the Reanimator's tower to find the cure to Princess Gloria's disease. There really isn't much else to the story until the end of the game, where you discover that there was actually a major decision point in the very first stage of the game that determines whether or not you'll kill or spare your enemies, and you'll have to replay the game to get the other ending. This decision point actually helps set up the conflict between the light countries and the Dark Realm in future installments of the Peacemaker series.

Although the Glorious Princess herself is mentioned in the title, we don't really get a lot of characterization for her, since she spends most of the game in the castle. We also don't really get the same amount of worldbuilding as Hero King Quest, so it's hard to tell what Bambooblade's homeland is like. At the very least, it's implied that the Silver Kingdom has different priorities from the Cerulean Land, but these priorities aren't specified. That said, there is a decent amount of characterization for the Reanimator, making it easier to appreciate her role in future installments.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

The gameplay is almost exactly the same as Case 02: Paranormal Evil. You have to make dice rolls to overcome events, and the number of dice you get depends on your stats. Personally, I find that this gameplay results in a lot of reloads on higher difficulties and is very punishing if you choose the wrong events to clear, so I played on the standard difficulty to save myself time.

Unlike Paranormal Evil, you can spare enemies by defeating them without a weapon, but this also makes strength checks harder and makes the final boss harder. The good ending is also locked behind a fist-only run, though there's still enough room for error on standard difficulty. I don't know if a fist run is possible on hard and extreme difficulty though, and I don't think I've seen any video uploads of the game on those modes.

[h2]Verdict[/h2]

7.5/10

This review is very short because the gameplay is something I have seen before and the story is also very simple and short compared to other games in the Peacemaker and Physical Exorcism series. However, I rated it higher than Paranormal Evil because I like the surprise twist of having a pacifist ending and I liked that the final boss gets a new moveset on this route to differentiate her from Gla'aki.",1,1653689087,176,0,70

843,1489410,"Overall very impressed with illuCallab.'s latest title!

Controls and physics are great, combat is really fun and feels a lot less ""like a dojin game"" than stuff like rabi-ribi or nyaruko did. Not a dig against those games, but Alice Escaped!'s battles feel much more polished than other dojin metroidvanias.

Has a really wonderful visual style, I love the chromatic aberration at the sides of the screen and Cuphead x kawaii-style enemy designs. The saturation and contrast feels a tiny bit off in a few areas, notably dark forest areas are -pitch black- and highlighted areas get a little washed out? I'm super picky about that stuff though, but it feels like a tiny adjustment would make the game a lot more vibrant. The character sprites are very complete design-wise and until someone other than Vanillaware spends a decade making an animation engine, the paperdoll Spine-style is the best we've got lol.

Only been through a little, but there are also decisions at story points that require a ""speech"" stat lol so it seems like replays are intended. Definite recommend based on the first bit I've played!

+ Cute anime girls being cute
+ Controls are responsive

My Dual Sense works natively and has correct button prompts but had to disable Steam Input in the controller properties before launching or it won't work at all. If your controller isn't working this should be the first thing you try. 

Works fine on the Steam Deck although the default controller setup for me was a keyboard/mouse template. Simply swapped the template to standard controller and everything was good to go with correct button prompts. 

Edit: Thanks for adding cloud saves!",1,1674860827,43,0,50
845,1489410,"Not enough to be worth the full price. There are other metrovanias that are similar price that offer way more content.

Story is alright, cute girls automatically misunderstanding each other and resorting to violence and then everyone becomes friends afterwards. 
The game had some neat concept that had me excited, In your skill tree there is an ability that lets you move and attack while in cut scenes and a skill that increases positive dialog chances sadly it was never really explored and only did more worse than good; if you attack Isabelle before she finishes talking she'll summon the entire army on you and you'll probably die. At most the skill will just lock yourself out of dialog options by attacking anyone mid cut scenes.

The death matches mechanics was pretty neat, it's a screen lock ambush encounter that forces you to kill the waves of enemies that spawn, some of which reset when you die, or re-enter the map. for the first hour where you get crystal fragments depending on how high your combo is and if you beat it hitless. had fun putting in effort to not get hit and keep a high combo to get the most fragments to upgrade my skills but you only get the basic blue crystals from them, by the time you're done the game you'll have an excessive excess of blue crystals that death matches become pointless. With the amount of back tracking you'd expect in a metrovania forcefully locking your character in a spot every time they trek back with enemy waves spawn ain't that fun after a couple revisits.

The combo system was pretty cool how you could change characters mid skills and have them continue their attacks, wish there were more variety to it though. 
My finger hurts from spam tapping the gatling guns fire. If you long hold the button you'll get your ultimate skill with a flashy animation lock and some iframes, so your only option is to tap the attack button if you don't want to accidentally fire your ult. On the other hand there are two separate buttons dedicated to map and menus both of which are a tab away from each other in the menu options, why? Ground hammer attacks are almost garbage because of the heavy animation lock that just feels very clunky. Why is the upgrade for Up Air for the hammer a low swing attack? it changes the omni-directional attack to a front and low spike attack that most likely would end your combo. You waste crystals and the skill gets worse .. and you can't remove it. Once you get enough crystals there is no point to finding secret passages since they're all skill crystals. and even heart containers you'll max out on them fairly early on. You already have all your movement options for the metrovania exploration in your skill tree, At most you'll just get excited finding a key. The only metrovania part of this game is the amount of extra back tracking you'll be doing once you do the necessary NG+++ to get the ""final"" ending. There is about 7 bosses and 6 or 7 unique zones. You'll be done your first playthrough in 4-5 hours if you're exploring everything.

It was an alright game but I felt more relief that it was over than the desire to play it more.",0,1683748008,612,0,12

847,1489410,"A great game but a little too expensive without discount considering the game is rather short.

848,1489410,"This is a cute Alice in Wonderland themed combat-centric metroidvania with a skill tree, multiple endings, air juggles, and all sorts of combos. While I think this is a genuinely fun game, I can only recommend this on a deep sale. It just doesn't have enough content to justify the price unfortunately. I also have a few issues with the game on top of that:

-You can't pause. Opening your menu does not pause the action nor is there any way to do so leading to some mildly frustrating situations. I feel any single player game should give the player the ability to pause. 

-Unlocking the true ending is overly tedious requiring you to retread areas and re-fight bosses numerous times. This is going to be exponentially worse if you are not following a guide. 

-Pretty much every boss fight in the game is underwhelming imo. 

-By default the game has this screen filter which makes me feel like I have beer goggles on and it's just not pleasant. You can turn off the filter but quitting and relaunching the game will result in this filter being enabled again. Why can't the game just remember your settings so you don't have to disable the filter every time you play it? 

-Repeatedly having to exit and reenter an area to slowly increase the affinity of an NPC so they can give you a key item to access a certain ending is not good game design. It's just tedious. 

-The trailer of this game hints at it having some darker undertones. Spoiler alert: it doesn't but man does the game tease it. Just want to let people know up front in case you are getting this because you are expecting some kind of tonal whiplash or shock value. 

Despite my complaints I still think this game is very polished with fun combat mechanics and beautiful art. It's a nice moe spin on Alice in Wonderland and the dev team behind it is clearly talented. I'll be looking forward to whatever they cook up next.",1,1677559651,600,0,125

The music, a harmonious symphony of sound and rhythm, is masterfully crafted to elevate the overall gaming experience to new heights. The gameplay is intuitive, challenging, and rife with opportunities to demonstrate one's dexterity and cunning. The story, a charming and whimsical tale that unfurls before the player, is leavened with moments of jocularity and levity, providing much-needed respite from the trials and tribulations of the game.

Moreover, the game's aesthetic, with its charmingly cute and whimsical art style, is nothing short of visually stunning. The imaginative world that has been created is a feast for the eyes, and every frame of the game exudes a sense of wonder and delight.

859,1489410,"It's an okay metroidvania to be honest. Enjoyable despite some of its kinks.

I initially enjoyed the game, but at some points trying to get the true ending, the game just puts you into very unfair situations that made my thoughts on this game more lukewarm. ""Death match"" areas where you have to survive through waves of enemies, typically puts you in small rooms which most of the time you'll probably are going to get hit by spawning enemies. Some of them puts you in areas where there's no invisible walls to prevent you from falling down the area and makes you restart the whole fight again, or even puts insta-kill spikes around the room with very small platforms for navigation. The spikes insta-kill you even on Casual difficulty, so players that are not good enough at video games trying to get the true ending will have to go through this torture.

The metroidvania aspect is quite good, although backtracking gets redundant as the game makes you go through the game again a few times for different endings, and these pick ups respawn each time you try again (except key items which are one-time pick ups). There are some QoL features such as locked doors are color-coded, upgrades that will tell you the location of some pick ups and some quests mark the location you have to go on the map.

The story opens up more as you repeat the game more, but there are some inconsistencies on the whole timeline of the story. The story is quite linear, but if you reach certain areas too soon, the game just assumes you've progressed through the game in the correct way. You can set up all the pieces required for the true ending, but if you go to a particular area, the game straight up puts you in a different ending without even thinking that it might conflict with the things you've already done before. It's not a deal-breaker to be fair, but I wished it could've been better.

Also, I wished there could be more CG's in this game. There's only two in this game; one where you start the game, and another during the tea party.",1,1675008000,782,0,76

864,1489410,"Overall I would say there wasn't much to make a good experience. 

For the positives the art is cute and the music is very good. The combat is whelmingly okay sans a couple of annoying encounters. It's woke and lgbt. Exactly 2 and a half characters were genuinely likable.

As for the negatives, the story involves repeating the same linear levels several times and refighting the same bosses anywhere from 2-10 times depending on how efficient your playthrough is. There are unskippable encounters blocking paths which just eats up more time and really should just stay deactivated after the first time unless you retrigger them. Some bosses are skippable with key items which is a weird decision given that the final boss of the normal ending presumably used moves from all the previous bosses that I skipped which just left me feeling like I missed on something. 

Additionally, the time rewinding mechanic means retreading the same areas and reading the same unskippable dialogue and fighting the same bosses many times .

The later combo strings do sometimes feel good but enemies can also just fall out of them just as easily. The enemies hit waaaaay too hard, most enemies towards the end game hit you for your entire health bar, meaning that assuming you have the sturdy ability you can only get out of combat with 2-3 hits at most which sounds simple except things can spawn on top of you and have armour that prevents them from being stunned. Kotora can sometimes get locked into facing one direction and the super moves for both Kotora and Usada will either fail to activate or activate in the wrong direction sometimes.

Additionally, the time rewinding mechanic means retreading the same areas and reading the same unskippable dialogue and fighting the same bosses many times .

There's not enough collectibles to raise yourself to the max level without rewinding time many times, which means retreading the same area you've already seen a squidillion times to grab one specific skill point gem then resetting again.

Additionally, the time rewinding mechanic means retreading the same areas and reading the same unskippable dialogue and fighting the same bosses many times .

The dialogue works find on the first go around, but there will be weird idiosyncrasies that depending on what point in the game you're at, there will either be new dialogue for the 2nd,3rd,4th go around but also scenes where you will have the same surprised reactions from the 1st run even though it's pointed out to you many times that you already know what's going to happen. It would be one thing if this was insular side content but this happens when interacting with major story characters, particularly how the tea party repeats itself and you are surprised to get the key every time. 

Additionally, the time rewinding mechanic means retreading the same areas and reading the same unskippable dialogue and fighting the same bosses many times .

876,1489410,"It is a good enough game with some more annoying flaws than anything else.

Story:

It revolves around two characters, who were pretty much pulled into the Alice and Wonderland story. That's pretty much it, their goal is to find Alice, but with a twist at the end.

Battle System:

Being a platformer, it combines the action with a ranged and close ranged character. Each is meant to be used in different situations, with their skills being unlocked from a tree. These points can be found from doing certain battles, or collected on the map. 

Now, this is when it gets clunky. The ranged option has very limited mobility, making it not good in many scenarios. The close ranged is too wild, making it difficult to aim. This is just a bad design, but not anything too concerning.

Balance:

Can use a lot of adjustments on this, especially since there isn't much variation in damage between modes. The game says Difficult, but really? It is more that it needs some more work on this end. The platforming is fine on the most part, but some are also very unreasonable.

Annoyance:

This game works with multiple endings, which by the way label the damn game correctly. And anyway, the format they were going for wasn't even done well. You have to replay large portions of the game over and over again in a loop. Then eventually, you'll get an item to teleport, but this has to be done specifically with a character for like two loops. Fortunately, this is the easier part. 

For future references, I'd advise looking at how Crystar or the Phantom Rose series has done this. The way it was implemented into the game was just annoying and a massive waste of time.

Overall:

Wish I could give the game a mixed, but it isn't bad enough to be down voted. So, take it as you may.",1,1714122705,682,0,57

The story itself isn't that deep and the main difficulty is if you do the achievement for hardcore cheshire cat without guard master, and no cheshire isn't hard the real menace is alice it took me 6 or 7 hours to finally beat alice and her unreasonable third phase where she pulls out a gun with aim bot, yes really.

 • Controls and mobility felt great. Wall jumping and 8 way dashing made for some great platforming sections and potentials skips.
 • Love the characters, level design, graphics. Colorful, vibrant and easy on the eyes with a lot of area/background variety.
 • Combat is fun and free flowing with a bunch of different attacks mapped to the X button + directions or holding the X button down for a super and the ability to swap characters to fit what you feel comfortable with (1 ranged and 1 melee character).
 • Large skill tree with a bunch of different upgrade options to pick from

897,1489410,"A cute, fun, and fairly good Wonderland and bunny-themed Metroidvania beat 'em up. Take the protagonists of Rabi-Ribi and the action combat of Guacamelee and throw them into Alice's world.

The good:
[list]
[*]Cute.
[*]Bunnies.
[*]Two playable characters, the hammer-wielding Usada who can perform a wide variety of melee attacks on both ground and air, and the gun-user Kotora who acts as ranged support. Both characters can be switched on the fly and have separate health and special skill meters.
[*]Skill Tree with an assortment of offensive, mobility, utility, and dialogue options. Skill Points come in very quickly from enemy encounters or as overworld collectibles so there's little need to actually grind battles for them.
[*]Fairly unique dialogue options, including a ""speech"" check to skip some bosses or learning the ability to move and attack NPCs mid-conversation.
[*]Multiple ending story. Game keeps going after one ending.
[*]Multiple difficulties that can be switched in-game.
[*]Devs have been actively patching the game; there's been 8 updates during the first week.
[*]2x bunnies = double cuteness.
[/list]

The so-so:
[list]
[*]Rather short, one ending can be acquired in at least 5 or so hours, and maybe another 3-5 more to get every ending.
[*]Air Dash doesn't recover until landing on a flat surface and not from walls, which can take a bit of getting used to.
[*]The multiple ending nature of the game can get kind of repetitive in certain parts, even though there are some ways to speed it up.
[*]Opening the ""pause"" menu doesn't actually pause the game and can't be opened at all during bosses, so make sure there are no enemies around before opening your map/inventory/skill tree.
[*]Kotora's sprite (clothing) doesn't match her artwork.
[*]There's too few CGs (two with some variations).
[/list]

The bad:
[list]
[*]Spikes are instant death, [strike]even on Casual difficulty[/strike]. 1.0.9 no longer instant death on Casual.
[*][strike]Pitfalls respawn enemies.[/strike]
[*][strike]Some death match rooms are a bit small and it's easy for enemies to instantly spawn on top of the player and immediately deal contact damage.[/strike] 1.0.9 made enemies act later if they spawn too close to you.
[*][strike]Only one save file.[/strike] Ending 4 can be missed (albeit with a difficult speech check) and the Speedrun and no-Card Master achievements require brand new playthroughs.

899,1489410,"A cute but surprisingly dangerous trip to Wonderland!

As a metroidvania enthusiast and someone who loves cute things, I couldn't resist this entry. 
Performance-wise, there are no issues even on my quite old PC. Stable frame-rate, haven't run into bugs or glitches, game randomly crashed once and that's it. Ticks the checkbox of a finely working game.
Visually, the game is gorgeous, especially if you love vibrant, colourful and cute design. It also manages to retain the wacky and quirky vibe of its inspiration source. 
The music is lovely. It helps setting the ambient and mood greatly and is generally pleasant to listen to. Coupled with the cute sound effects, it rounds up the experience nicely. 
The story is at times funny, at times weird. Just like the source material the game took inspiration from.
Edited part:
After getting all the endings, I can only say that I have my gripes with some major difficulty spikes. And that's after clearing Bombservice games (""Momodora: Reverie under the Moonlight"" and ""Minoria"")
Overall: I somewhat cautiously recommend this game. If you are not a metroidvania veteran, you might have a hard time with some instances even on the lowest difficulty.

Nice visuals and story/concept are good.  But the game play is horrible...SEE DISCUSSIONS.  Well, now I know why it only costs 5.99...u get what you pay for.  

Inventory system is broke, items disappear from inventory when you die; items that are needed to complete the game.  Game mechanics are just not smooth,  and difficult at best to proceed through the game.  Game has a tendency to automatically transport you to another location without touching the controls...especially on Quest.  Audio is not in sync with game play in many places.

With this option enabled the game felt much better (It actually ""unlocked"" a hidden mechanic, which allowed me to glide through the levels by shooting down). 😁

It's not perfect, but even with its tiny flaws I had a really good time with it. I beat it after two or three sittings.",1,1710255793,346,0,50
990,1489620,"This game is kind of a hard sell, as it does so little to justify it's $20 price tag.

Let me start with the positives first. The gameplay is nice and easy to understand if you're familiar with Bomberman-style games, and even if you're new to this kind of game, the tutorial does a decent job at explaining the fundamentals. The character design is simple but cute, and the customization with headgear is nice as well. Lastly, the music is hands down the best aspect about this game, it has no reason to go this hard.

Now that I'm done with the positives, where do I even begin with my negatives?
Having 50 levels sure sounds nice up until you realize that the only thing that changes between levels is the layout and world theme, otherwise they all play exactly the same and have no gimmicks to make things interesting, such as conveyor belts to move the player or bombs around, trapdoors that move the player to a different trapdoor located in the stage, a stage with no soft blocks that starts you off at full power, or arrows on the floor to redirect kicked bombs, except that... you can't kick bombs in this game, which leads me to my next point.
The variety of power ups is very lacking, there are some interesting new ones such as glue and watering cloud, but otherwise there's not much variety, we don't have power ups that let us kick bombs, make a line of bombs ahead of us, carry bombs, or punch bombs (these last two maybe because the character does not have hands). One annoying thing in regards to how power ups work in this game is how when you collect a sickness handicap, you're unable to pick up any power ups until the effect wears off, which is not a thing at all in other style of games like this one, perhaps even worse is that when a player is defeated, their power ups don't scatter around the stage, so none of the remaining players get to steal their items and instead are just gone until the next match.
There are not many game modes either, you have the standard battle mode and the key picker modes, but there's not a team battle mode to set up games of 2v2 or 1v3, or a mode where players have to fight for a crown and wins whoever has it on by the time the clock hits zero, or a mode where players compete to collect items that give off points and whoever has the most points by the end of the timer wins. I also noticed that while the max player count is of four players, this game can very well handle up to eight players, as demonstrated by the key picker mode when there are four human players and four AI players, it would be great if more than four people could play together, even if it was just a local multiplayer option if the online couldn't handle up to eight. Speaking of online mode, I really haven't been able to test it out properly, as every time I try to connect I only get paired with guest controlled by the AI, I guess there's just nobody playing this game, and why would they be when Super Bomberman R 2 released a day prior to this game?

I don't think this game is necessarily bad, if the goal was to make an arcade-like game that is easy to pick up and play, I think they've succeeded at that, but my problem is just how expensive this game is for how little it offers, while there is replay value as a party game to play with friends, you can easily see all what this game has to offer in less than an hour, it's just when you want to get all achievements and cosmetics when you'll go a bit over the two hours limit to refund games. Let's not forget that this game was originally going to be made for the Intellivision Amico, which in it's 2018 reveal trailer, they said that games for the platform would aim for a $3 to $8 price point, which I think $6 is the most reasonable for this game, maybe $8 just because the music is really that good.",0,1694833469,463,0,3

So this is one of the strangest games I have played in a while, and I really like it. At its simplest, its an atmospheric rougelite horror game. You pick up a strange glowing sword and are told ""Light is my sword. Darkness shall perish"", and proceed to wander a dark forest fending off monsters until you die.

In the beginning, you will die extremely quickly (less than a minute even), and may make very little progress, or even none at all. If you find this kind of thing frustrating, or are expecting a faster paced game, you will likely have an experience similar to many of the negative reviews, and feel like there's nothing to see.

If you stick it out however... there are more things to see an do, and you can survive a surprising amount of time (My current record is 21 minutes, 17th on the global leaderboard *humblebrag*).

1002,1489600,"between this and intraquartz i have so much appreciation for how the soundscape drives these unique exploratory experiences. in that sense the frequent comparisons to devil daggers are admittedly spot-on, not just because of their shared interest in the occult but because success in both titles very much hinges on how well you can attend to every proverbial bump in the dark. even surviving for ten minutes in both titles is an accomplishment in and of itself, so it's worth pointing out the primary difference here lies in agency and pace. the whims of devil daggers are immediate, its action is centered on a singular arena, and there's a learning curve bent towards player mastery. nix umbra however relishes in making you feel helpless in this never-ending forest even when you have become more well-versed with the title's quirks. maybe the lack of gratification isn't a particularly compelling selling point for the average steam user, but to me it's part and parcel of the experience and it's what keeps each desperation-laden run fresh. runs in nix umbra can go wrong very quickly, which might seem mechanically unfair, but it asks that you keep composed no matter the situation at hand. by contrast, i think every devil daggers player is kind of intimately familiar with that unfortunately second-nature experience of the first three or four minutes of a run being essentially the gameplay equivalent of dead air. in other words, despite a shared emphasis on global leaderboards, one of these titles is more overtly an arcade experience and the other chooses to prioritize the esoteric qualities of survival horror. arguably this makes nix umbra less truly competitively-oriented, but there is an appeal to trying to figure out how to make the best of the bad situations on offer.

A purist high score grind akin to Devil Daggers or an odd, esoteric journey like that of perhaps No One Lives Under the Lighthouse.

It's very tense with some great sound effects and visual design but within an hour or so the mystery falls away and you're left with a very bare-bones experience.

This was one of the more difficult reviews I’ve ever written (I actually hit the character limit, which I didn’t even know existed), so please forgive me if I repeat myself or trip over my words from time to time.

[hr][/hr]
Nix Umbra is much slower than any other arena shooter I’ve ever played, and without some sort of guide or tutorial, many of the mechanics would be completely lost on me. In Devil Daggers, guides can certainly help you come up with new strategies or maybe even learn tough sequences, but the mechanics themselves are easy enough to figure out without any help.

The gameplay here [i]can[/i] speed up the further you get into a run, but actually getting to that point can be a tedious slog, and one which depends almost entirely on RNG. Without that fast-paced style of gameplay, there’s no rush of blood-pumping adrenaline, and the game becomes quite dull as a result.

[hr][/hr]
Nix Umbra’s gameplay can be easily split into two distinct categories; collection and survival. We’ll start with the collection aspect.

This game uses crystals as a currency. These crystals can be collected in-game for numerous reasons, which we’ll go over later. Due to the game’s intense artstyle, it can be fairly difficult to tell where these crystals are located, and player progress is hindered as a result. The stars mark the locations of crystals, and you can see the outline of them through the sword, but with such a thick layer of brush to trudge through, using either of these methods is easier said than done.

Say a run takes 5 minutes and you’re consistently collecting 10 crystals per run. To unlock all 25 color schemes (Essentially the only rewards this game has to offer), you’ll need to collect a grand total of 10000 crystals. That’s 83 hours of gameplay. 83 hours of tediously walking around in the dark looking for the slightest indication that there’s a shiny gem hovering about somewhere nearby. This may appeal to some people, but to me, that’s a substantial grind for a pretty shitty reward.

[i][u]Tangent Warning.[/u][/i]

I’ll admit, I tried to cheat in the crystals just to see if the rewards got any better, but it didn’t end up working… So I resorted to datamining instead. It’s there that I discovered paths 260-283, each matching the name of a corresponding in-game filter; 1 white, 1 grey, 3 red, 3 green, 4 yellow, 5 pink, 6 blue, and the classic black and white color scheme. No, you didn’t miscount. There’s a missing filter. Curious, I dug a little further and revealed path 259; an ominous behaviour simply titled ‘Blue Castle’. Although missing the ‘nixumbra’ prefix the rest of the filters had, it referenced the same path as the rest, leading me to the conclusion that it was our last missing filter. Unfortunately though, that was the only clue I managed to scrounge up about the nature of this potentially unique reward. Suffice to say I was disappointed to find that not only was it another basic-ass color scheme, but it wasn’t even the last one you unlock.

[i][u]Tangent Over.[/u][/i]

Color schemes aside, another reason to collect crystals is to level up. In Devil Daggers, you get kills to level up, and these levels will make survival easier. The longer you survive, the higher your place on the leaderboard. In Nix Umbra, levelling up will give you a single item of your choosing to help collect crystals more efficiently. These items will be lost at the end of each run, much like they would in a roguelike. The problem is that crystals don’t affect your position on the leaderboard. Much like Devil Daggers, the leaderboard is determined almost exclusively by your survival time, and unfortunately very few of these items actually help in that regard, not to mention that you lose all of the progress you’ve made towards a level up if you activate a secret, get attacked by certain enemies, or accidentally bump into a tree. Where Devil Daggers perfectly weds the Collectathon and FPS genres, Nix Umbra has a clear dichotomy between the two.

[hr][/hr]
So once you’ve unlocked all the color schemes, the only goal left to work towards is a higher position on the leaderboard. This is where we move on to the survival aspect of the game. In Nix Umbra, you climb the ranks quickly. Most Devil Daggers players would consider 400 seconds a great personal achievement. Here, it was the score of my first run, landing me a place in the top 300. By the second run, I was in the top 200. About an hour later, top 50. Not too long after that, top 20. This was less than 2 hours into the game. I wasn’t even trying to get a good score, I was just grinding for crystals. The only reason I have another 3 and a half hours in-game is because I collected 800 crystals manually before I remembered that save editing was a thing.

In comparison, I’m still hovering around the 14k mark in Devil Daggers, and that’s after 17 hours of gameplay. Now with statistics like this, popularity does of course have to be taken into account, but there isn’t really any way to see user sales unless you’re a developer. We can use third-party sites such as Steamspy, but these sites can only makes assumptions, leading to skewed statistics that suggest this game has over 20k sales. If we assume there are 20k players with a consistently inclining skill level, based on my Devil Daggers statistics, that would mean my initial leaderboard position should’ve been around 3500. Now I have no way to gage what is and isn’t a good score as the leaderboard only displays 10 users at a time; maybe I’m legitimately good at the game, maybe there just isn’t that much competition. Either way, the playerbase has been dead for about half a year and top place is ripe for the picking, that is if you don’t mind walking around in sheer darkness for almost 2 hours straight. Given how easy it was to get to the top 20, I think it’s definitely an achievable goal for someone who actually gives a shit. On the other hand, Devil Daggers is still averaging 25 players daily almost 7 years after release. There, the world record is 1163 seconds. Here, that doesn’t even cut the top 10, because the game is just that much slower. Without naming any names, it’s worth noting that multiple top 10 members for this game aren’t even in the top 50k for Devil Daggers. Some aren’t even top 100k. I don’t mean to criticise or belittle, it’s just something to consider if you came looking for a challenge.

[hr][/hr]
I’ve seen a couple of people say that this game takes the concept of Devil Daggers and brings it into more of a horror environment. I disagree. At no point during this game did I ever feel any sort of fear. In Devil Daggers, the adrenaline conjures fear, but as we established at the start of this review, this game gives you no adrenaline. You could argue that the horror is in the eerie, suspenseful atmosphere… But this game [i]has[/i] no atmosphere. You can’t see more than a few feet in front of you at any given moment. You might get the outline of a skull in the distance or a pair of glowing eyes accompanied by violin noises, but that’s it. The rest of the game is sheer darkness. Some atmosphere.

One thing the game has going for it is that it can be played mindlessly. About 80% of my playtime was spent just farming crystals whilst watching Youtube on my second monitor.

Finishing a run doesn’t feel rewarding, and I don't find leaderboards particularly motivating, so without any achievements or even a sense of achievement, I don’t feel compelled to keep playing. If you prefer a slower style of gameplay, then by all means, pick yourself up a copy. The game isn't inherently bad, I just find Devil Daggers to be a slightly cheaper and far more enjoyable alternative.",0,1676919057,338,0,346
1016,1489600,"It’s like Devil Daggers, only it looks worse, sounds worse, plays worse and costs more. Not particularly fun or scary.

1017,1489600,"This is one of those games that I wish allowed me to leave a neutral review on. I'm a fan of horror that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares. I'm a fan of shooters. This game is both of those things, kind of. A lot of people have summarized what Nix Umbra is well in their reviews. The one about Devil Daggers and  Sunn O))) is so poetically accurate, if you're familiar with those.

Nix Umbra doesn't tell the player much of anything. You see a sword, you grab the sword and that's kind of it. You hold left click and a bit more visual is revealed to the player. While you hold left click, the Sun meter in the bottom right corner of the screen drains. If that empties you die and start over. You can also be killed by the various enemies around the map. Most of my deaths I wasn't even aware an enemy was near or I had been hit. One death I was sucked into the sky for seemingly no reason. Enemies can be killed by that same left click that illuminates the screen/drains your health. As far as I can tell you don't need to hit or aim directly at the enemies to kill them, either.

As you explore orbs can be collected. Once enough have been gathered, you will be granted an option of a power up. I only have done this once and chose boots that allowed me to move faster. The orbs you collect in game are then pulled over to the main menu with an X/50 notification. I'm not sure what happens when you reach that goal.

I don't have fun playing Nix Umbra. I don't find it particularly scary but it does have a really unique and cool atmosphere. It isn't really a shooter. I won't find out what the other power ups do. I won't find out what happens when I collect 50 orbs. I won't play much, if any, beyond the ~20 minutes I've put into it. It simply isn't for me and isn't what I expected. I'm not faulting anyone for this. I bought it simply because of the price and I'm a fan of it's presentation. I didn't check out any videos or streams on it. Because of this I want to leave a neutral review, but I can't so I'll leave a positive one.

The subtle way enemies and the environment appear and disappear from your sight, the sounds that surround you at all times, and the gameplay that is never explained create an atmosphere of dread and despair but in an exciting way.

1044,1489600,"Nix Umbra is the net sum of numerous folk horror films post-processed down to monochrome and then blended into an effective yet simplistic arena shooter.

The core gameplay boils down to a relatively slow-moving, nigh-combatless arena shooter with limited mechanics: you're walking through a sparsely-wooded forest, the only light sources being the stars and the very sword in your hand. Via a simplistic UI, your purpose is to survive as long as possible, balancing your health and mana, which are combined into one bar. Various creatures of the night hover and skitter around you, whittling down your health while you feebly fend them off with the aforementioned weapon.

While there are power-ups and a vague sense of progression via collectibles, I would say the presentation and atmosphere here far outweigh any compelling gameplay mechanics. Thankfully, the look and feel of the game are bar-none. The sound design is integral to the gameplay, and the visuals, as noted by all other reviewers, are absolutely striking and simultaneously bleak. You'll be barraged by psychedelic imagery and visual effects on a constant basis. My hair was standing on end for the entirety of my playthroughs.

In my opinion, the price point is rather high for the gameplay on offer here, but if you're the target demographic for this aesthetic (I am), you'll enjoy being whisked away into this dismal wonderland.

1052,1489680,"I'm going to rate this positive, but with caveats. It's just your basic Picross game, which is what I wanted, but there were a few negative things. 

The first and largest was that if you leave on the option for it to grey out completed clues, which is a standard option for these types of games, it actually bases whether the clue gets greyed out or not on whether you have the correct squares marked, not simply if you have the same number of squares marked as the clue says. As an example, since that's hard to describe, if you had a row with 10 squares and a clue that said 3, it wouldn't grey it out if you randomly filled in 3 squares in a row. It would only grey it out if you filled in the actual correct 3 squares. Even if you have no other squares filled in on the board, it will grey out the clue even though there's no logical way you could have deduced those squares yet. So it gives you information about the puzzle instead of just being the simple quality of life feature that it should be. It should grey out clues just so you're not having to constantly double check and recount your filled in squares, not to check whether you have something correct or not. So it was frustrating that I either had to get clues for the puzzle or go without that virtually essential feature that I'm used to from every other Pircross video game.

A couple other negatives were that it didn't fill in the 0 rows with X's automatically, that the puzzles never got particularly hard and that it was pretty short. It took me less then three and a half hours to finish all the puzzles, when I'm used to sinking 10s of hours into Picross games since it's pretty easy to make more puzzles. One thing you can do, though, is generate a random 5x5, 10x10 or 15x15 puzzle, so that can add some replay time. However, with that greying out issue I mentioned, I'd rather play extra puzzles in one of the other many Picross games on Steam, so I doubt I'll revisit this.

So it's a decent little Picross game, but it could use a couple of improvements and more premade puzzles. But I'll still give it a thumbs up overall. But honestly, I'd only buy it if you've already played most of the other popular Picross games you can find on Steam.",1,1675365803,202,0,55

- If you drag your mouse too fast, it skips tiles.
- The algorithm to dim number sets you've marked isn't smart enough to figure out that it should only dim numbers if it can prove you're correct without knowing the solution. In other words: if you need to select 1 tile in a row, you can just try every time until you see the number go dim. This takes away a lot of the challenge if you rely on it, and takes away from the fun if it gives away that you've made a mistake.
- By default the settings are set to detect mistakes which gets frustrating real fast. Make sure to turn that off.
- There are ""challenge modes"" but they seem quite gimmicky. One of them removes numbers after a while which is just strange because it may make puzzles unsolvable if you don't solve them quick enough.

1072,1489680,"A polished nonogram/picross game for beginners. The aesthetics are pleasing to the eyes and ears, and the core gameplay is implemented well. Experienced nonogram players will find the puzzles very easy, but it is still an enjoyable and relaxing way to pass some time.

There are a good number of puzzles, but most are very simple and go by quickly. The random puzzle generator would be a great feature to add replay value, but often the generated puzzle will turn out to have multiple solutions and can only be solved by guessing, which spoils the fun. If this were fixed, the random puzzle generator could be the basis for features like a daily challenge, or sharing puzzle codes (random seeds) to challenge your friends.

The other features like Challenges (game rule modifiers) and theme customization do not really improve the game much, but they don't hurt it either. The theme gacha machine is an anti-feature, making the game feel like a tacky free-to-play game, but this is a minor complaint.

My biggest complaints are regarding accessibility. The visual contrast is very low on the puzzle board (grid lines, etc.), which makes it difficult to count squares, especially if your eyes are not the best, or if you have glare on your screen. Likewise, much of the UI has low contrast and is a bit small. Lastly, keyboard and gamepad support would be a very nice improvement to benefit all players.

Overall though, the game gets the core gameplay right, it is inexpensive, and I had a nice time playing it.",1,1641238011,102,0,6

One of the bigger things in this game is the style options. This is a neat idea, but most of the styles made it actually difficult for me to solve the puzzle.
There are also challenges, but they are tucked away in a corner and give nothing for doing them, not even a little tick on the puzzle or any kind of counter going up.
I would recommend buying this game if you've already beaten games like Pictopix, but are still itching for more picross.",1,1640634355,246,0,16
1075,1489680,"A simple and well-done nonogram puzzler. Don't know what a nonogram is? I didn't either originally. You're given a 5x5 to 15x15 grid where you need to use basic logic to figure out which cells to activate. There are numbers written outside of each row and column which provide clues. A completed puzzle forms a crude bit of pixel art of a dog or car etc. Similar games I've played are are Minesweeper (except here you can make multiple errors by default) or Hexcells (except here only one or two puzzles seemed impossible without guessing). The whole thing's pretty casual and totally worth full price, although it's had monthly 50% sales lately.

~Relaxing music, but only four or so tracks

~English only, though you could muddle through it by icons and numbers

~No cloud saves, but you can copy save file from here:
 C:\Users\[username]\AppData\LocalLow\Kenney\Pixross\Pixross.sav

~Puzzles only save when completed. I'd list this as a negative, except since most puzzles take between 15 
seconds and 5 minutes, it isn't that big of a deal.

My playtime is a little inflated because I left the game running a few times so I could finish a puzzle after doing something else, but the game is still well worth the tiny price tag.

[*]This is a very solid implementation of nonogram puzzles. 
[*]Options allow for things like drag only applying to a single row or column.  Excellent for people like me who are not always steady with the mouse.
[*]You have not just the box and X, but also a temporary marker as well.  I find the temporary marker extremely helpful in the games which have it when I'm trying to count out squares.  Honestly, it should be mandatory in these games.
[*]You can have the numbers fade when that item is complete.  It will fade only those numbers which are completed, even if they are not surrounded by X yet.
[*]The artwork is great.  Unlike another game I tried after this one, I could actually tell what things were.
[*]There are tons of customizations you can get by earning points completing puzzles.  It's a neat feature.
[*]No microtransactions at all!  (I just ran into those in another game, so I want to make a point of that.)
[/list]
[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b][list]
[*]A puzzle cannot be saved part way through.  For some of the larger puzzles, this would have been important as I had to quit one due to being called away more than once.
[*]If you want to play without the limited number of errors, everything is in black and white until the puzzle is solved.  I could get through most of the puzzles with error limits without a problem, but I found the hassle of an error being deducted annoying when I accidentally misclicked.  (But you can increase the number of errors allowed.)
[*]The larger randomly created puzzles have too few large numbers of boxes on rows and columns, quickly resulting in situations where there is no logical way to solve the puzzle and you have to just guess.  I hate guessing.

Camera sensitivity was at 9000, wonky, the game was way too glitchy and couldnt be processed fast enough even with a very good graphics card and processor, it was [i]UNPLAYABLE[/I].

So I deleted the game at that time hoping that I there would be a patch at some point that would fix this steaming heap of horse crap. And it came!

And the game is still trash. No settings page so you cannot change the overly convulted key binds, the still extremely high mouse camera sensitivity or the graphics quality so your expensive graphics card can actually do its job like it does with Dark Souls but cannot for this cheap knockoff for some reason. No item or spell information, so good luck guessing what to  equip! The tutorial is a trashy, glitchy video of someone ""playing"" the game... by... opening he key binding window and defeating the first mob.

Do not let the trailer fool you, I bet the trailer itself cost more than the entire game budget did. This game is Dark Souls, if Dark Souls was made by one of those scummy predatory chinese companies that do cheap blatant rip-offs of famous games for low prices. This game simply lacks EVERYTHING that made Dark Souls famous: it has no story, no lore, no item or spell descriptions, the combat is exremely unpolished, the controls are dogshit, the menu screen is worse than some Flash games seen on Friv, the bow is useless in any type of situation and spells deal little to no damage. 

This game SHOULD NOT have been approved to be sold here. That 2$ cheap ""hentai"" game bundle you can find if you look at the shop is actually worth its price more than this game when it was on the dicount for 0.79 euros. The trailer is a scam to promote this pile of trash. Do NOT buy this game, especially if you saw the trailer and thought how cheap such a good game is.

Mining took forever, for resources I don't even know what I'm supposed to do with. Most games like this quickly get you crafting some essentials just to get you introduced to the crafting system. This gives you nothing.

- Inventory bugs out regularly and fills up with ghost items you can't interact with (annoying, but a reload usually fixes that; until it happens again of course)
- Items within the inventory occasionally disappear (an absolute nogo; I lost a hand full of the late game equipment that takes hours to craft and/or are expensive to buy that way)
- Descriptions of related Items are identical. You have to guess which is the better one. And there are no details (like the duration of the item's effect)
- Enemies regularly clip through the walls, leading to surprise attacks from nowhere.
- Enemies are STUPID. There are only two attack patterns. Melee enemies will fly towards you in a straight line and ranged enemies fly in a horizontal circle around you.

The UI isn't great either, it need a lot of polishment, but it's not THAT BAD once you get used to it. Cool graphics, nothing fancy but isn't bad either, the environment and everything, blood cells, white cells, bacteria, virus and parasites are nicesish, which in my point of view is good because the game could probabbly run on most pc's.

I haven't played much, because the game DOESN'T HAVE AUTO SAVE, SO IF YOU DIE WITHOUT SAVING FIRST, BYE BYE HOURS OF GRINDING AND FARMING (happened to me, 2,6 hours wasted and because of that i don't intend getting back to the game anytime soon).

Another thing, I missed a good map, showing where I'd be inside the human body, not as just some ""red cave system"" as it currently is.

Despite the game's flaws, it is really interesting AND YOU GET TO SHOOT CORONA VIRUS WITH LASERS. I was having a good time until I died and lost everything.

Another thing, I don't usually write reviews, but the in game menu really asked to do it SO I HOPE MY REVIEW MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

Anyways, on discount tottally worth it. Full price only if the devs fix this stuff, or you are extremely angry at diseases and REALLY want to shoot lasers at them",1,1637296182,154,0,22

1176,1489120,"Just finished getting 3 stars on all tracks and let me tell you it was quite an enjoyable journey. I could barely complete a single track by the end of the first day playing it, but pretty soon I started getting 1,2, and even 3 stars on the easy tracks. The game certainly has a learning curve, but a very satisfying one. I've never seen anyone online but I imagine getting a friend to play would be quite chaotic.

The customization is really cool and open but also feels a little barren and clunky. I built a staircase in my apartment that reaches even higher than the top of the building and that is about as much fun as I think I will have with it. I guess what I'm saying is that the furniture on offer is good but there aren't really multiple choices, just make it whatever color you want. This means that if you put a lot of effort into your apartment and really fill it out, it will look very similar to anyone else who has done the same, just different color schemes. This isn't really a bad thing, but it doesn't make me want to go super in depth with making a cool house is all.

After nearly mastering the controls for the car I can with out a doubt say that they work well enough. There is as of right now, a bit of a quirk in the engine when it comes to controlling the car in the air. To explain the issue I first have to explain how steering works. While moving forward, hitting left on the control stick activates the rocket on the right tire, causing you to go left. While reversing, hitting left on the control stick activates the rocket on the left tire, causing you to go right. This all makes sense in the context of the ground and how actual tires work but it is difficult to get used to in the air. I would be willing to write that off as a small quirk but the issue is worse. To illustrate this I will give the example of driving the car in the water around the plaza because that is just like being in the air, but without the falling. So, if you are driving forwards and you let go of the acceleration and hit the deceleration for a second, you slow down but you are still moving forwards. Hitting left on the control stick activates the rocket on the left making you turn right. Again I'd think this was another quirk but this behavior does not happen on the ground, only in the air and in the water. In short, left and right are determined by what direction you are traveling on the ground. In the air, left and right are determined by which thruster was input last.

Even this quirk is a little hard to notice but it does come up in a couple of the tracks. At first I thought I was just bad at controlling the car in the air but as I figured out how to fly it like a space ship I soon learned of this flaw.

Over all I'd say this game is worth getting even if you just want to check out the short story, make a character, and play with customizing your apartment.",1,1657868364,2275,0,44

It never felt like attained perfect mastery, but I think with enough time and effort I could see people pulling off wild things with these controls. Either way, it was fast paced, engrossing and the resets were quick, which meant even when I wasn't doing so hot it still felt great to play.

I picked this up because it was cheap and had relatively interesting customizable mechanics. I'm not really a fan of racing/time trial games, honestly I kind of almost hate them, but I still wanted to check this game out.
but YEAH, THIS GAME IS GOOD.

The artstyle is extremely cute. You got these goofy looking characters just stumbling around and its hilarious.
The models for houses and other misc items also look really good, as well as the cars.

The customizability is already decently good, and more is yet to come. You get to choose face details as well as colors and outfit choices. You also get your own room which you can decorate and invite people to lounge in. 

The gameplay is honestly a little difficult. Like right out the gate you may feel a little discouraged. If you are not willing to put in some effort to get used to the driving you may get turned off by this game. Its Rocket League-ey and extremely drifty and floaty, but it pulls off really well with the track design. Some tracks are kinda annoying to deal with these hard controls (I hate 2-3 and 2-4), but eventually you ""get good"" and finish the track.
(Also the game recommends controller/gamepad. I played with keyboard. Controls felt great to me, so don't worry too much if you don't have a controller.)

THE OST IS SO GOOD. Like I mean what the hell? I WAS NOT expecting this game to have such a banger OST. 
It has a nice eurobeaty type EDM theme, and for a game that kinda seems like a joke, its pulled off beautifully. 
For the devs or any data-miners/rippers out there, PLEASE upload the OST for this game somewhere!

For length, the game at the moment has 10 tracks, going from tracks 1-1 to 1-4, 2-1 to 2-4, and 3-1 to 3-2.
There is also a boxing/PVP mode and a seperate ""Star Driver Club"" Room for racing oriented fun instead of time dwindling. Beating and getting triple stars for each track and completing all quests as well as buying all the cars and getting a good looking room took me around 8-9 hours.

All in all, this game is a blast to play, and is very fun. It is a massive shame that I see no one talking about it or playing it, as most servers are usually completely dead. I've been in many different servers and lobbies, but only saw like 2 people.

To summarize 1-1, i had to do a tight but wide left to right 270 into a 90 into a ramp that you have to take a bit to the right to jump onto a platform you cant see at that angle very well into an extremely tight 270 right to left turn pike uphill. All while passing through gates that do not cover the width of the pathway. doing all that in 29 seconds and some change, im rewarded with a 1 star rating.

While i like what you are doing here aesthetically, I simply don't see what your crowd is. Do you want casual social gamers? those type of gamers don't like dark souls difficulty with dirt 3 snow physics. 

When the physics are tight and i die, i know it's my fault. When the physics are sloppy and i die, i blame it on the physics. The car is too slippery, too fast, and too unpredictable.

Game is probably the only survival game I've enjoyed for it's simplicity. Starting the tutorial by giving the flower to the chick was hecka confusing since it's hard to figure out how to even give her items. I ran into a bunch of glitches if you die once it goes into Portuguese and you can't turn it back without restarting the whole game and reading the whole intro again. I gave her a strawberry as a separate item without it being a completed fruit bowl it wouldn't allow me to make fruit bowls anymore. Not sure if this is a glitch but death comes at 1/3 will power instead of empty and just straight up ganks you so you have to keep it above half to be safe. The bonfire says 3 stones 2 kindling as well but it seems to actually take 2 stones and 3 kindling. That early access to be continued hurt my soul though after struggling through the glitches. Great start to a game but man after waiting for 30 minutes that hurt. Game is cute dialogue so far is pretty fun and the main thing I look forward to so far.

1232,1489150,"This game is very delightful on the first play through and I hope to change my mind in later releases. The game starts with an interesting narrative involving a girl having a car accident and her soul being released from her body. After a short dialogue with ""death"" we quickly find ourselves in a forest staring over our characters body and wondering what to do.

 There were no prompts, hints or any directions given to the player and considering the ridiculously small time frame you have to actually leave the locale of the body before being killed, there is little chance for the player to actually understand what is required without multiple failures and a sprinkle of luck that the items you need are actually nearby.  

A phone indicates a timer of one hour? Are we expected to sit protecting the girl for this long in one sitting? Perhaps I was confused or missed something.

I managed to build all of the items in one attempt to then find myself just sat on the body doing nothing for around 5 minutes.  Eventually the things you build collapse and you need to craft them again and so the loop continues endlessly without any indication of progression or if there is any more to the game than this small scene. 

After an hour of waiting around and eventually being killed by death enough times, I got bored and decided I had enough of not feeling like the game was actually going anywhere.

I won't be recomending this game on this occasion.

Nonetheless, the artistic direction and world building are phenomenal. The developers really thought out a unique and interest world for me to engage in. It's set on an alien world, never before seen or heard of — Uranus. Apparently this name is rooted in deep, real world, mythology. Way to go devs!

The lack of controls, resolution support, a menu, ability to exit the game, and gameplay in general really drove me to appreciate the vast world building. How immersive!

Review:
This game was sick I enjoyed the hell out of it finally a cheaper game that's not just super bad or a cash grab. This was definitely worth the money it hearkens me back to the days of finding the weird part of youtube which is hard to find. Insanely creepy and surreal but it also keeps a pretty tangible story. The game is pretty dang hard to get the good ending in as well the timing on the tongues gave my fingers one of the most insane rejection of what I wanted to do ever I was so used to timing up the tongues when I was trying to run through the 4 back to back tongues in case they were programmed to be a straight run through my fingers absolutely noped me from being so used to waiting on the timing and the fact the punishment for losing on that stage is severe since it's the only stage without a save before it. That rejection of what I actually wanted to do gave me one of the most severe feelings of defeat in a video game to be honest. I cannot recommend this enough I hope the sound track gets sold on here as well it was super good.",1,1619775613,151,0,992
1272,1488540,"I've gotten most of the endings except for A (I will cover later why I ended up giving up on this ending), along with trying to be thorough in my playthrough and, I gotta say, compared to their other games, Decaying Delicacy is just kind of disappointing. To be clear, there is a lot of potential here, story wise and with the zany elements, but the gameplay and presentation of the story left a lot to be desired. 

First off, I think it's important to future buyers to be perfectly clear about the gameplay loop. For the majority, if not almost all, of the runtime, you are basically going to be running through mazes, trying not to be caught by monsters, each iteration becoming more difficult with unique challenges such as enemies only becoming visible at certain times, movable objects, increased enemies, and sound cues. The concept is cool in theory, yet dull in practice, as this means Decaying Delicacy lacks the interesting environments, characters, horror, and opportunities for story that their other games have. 

Moreover, the maze is extremely unforgiving, and, if you bump into an enemy even once, rather than being able to try again, you're sent down the path of an ending. I gave Red Haze a hard time, but, at least that game restarted by default and did give you options to continue on and try again. If going through all of that to unlock some snippets of text for an admittedly intriguing story sounds interesting or fun to you, hey, this might actually be the little experience for you.

Secondly, since I brought it up earlier, it's time to finally address it; the story. It's not a bad one. I think its attempts to cover the idea of dreams vs reality and how the traumas of our life can come back to haunt us even in dreams is a really interesting one. That being said, this game mostly tells you everything about the story rather than showing. This is because, as I said, most of the story is conveyed through the main character talking to herself through text. After you complete each maze, you are given snippets of text that further explains the situation and how she's feeling/suffering currently. So, while the idea at their core is good, the presentation was boring and unfulfilling to me, as I felt I was being given scraps of an idea, but never stepping close to the fuller picture.

I've gotten all the endings except for one, and while I found the basic idea around each interesting, along with having potential, the way they were presented feels more flashy than actually being productive. I could tell you visually what I saw and some vague inferences from each, but nothing that would take me closer to actually understanding what the story was trying to convey. At each of the endings, I felt how I do at the [i]beginning[/i] of most Yai Gameworks titles, which really isn't a good sign.

In short, the idea is good, I think some refinement of its elements could work well in a longer, more story based game...albeit with more to do besides mazes. The end result however feels hollow. All That being said, out of all the Yai Gameworks titles I have played, this is the weakest in my opinion. It lacks what their better titles have, and is just an hour or so long of the worst parts of My Hole Is a Mouth of Dirt. An interesting idea suffered by being forced into such a short experience, and, besides three moments [spoiler]the sleeping or dead test, the bad ending, and level 9[/spoiler] nothing truly unnerved or scared me in this title. 

That being said, this definitely isn't the title to judge the creator on, and I assure you they have much better titles, including ones you can support them through (or free ones you can buy the soundtrack through to support them). Close Your Eyes (great starting point and probably the most popular for a reason), Feast Your Eyes, My Hole Is a Mouth of Dirt, and Take The Dream IX are just a few that come to mind. I'd say explore those titles and skip this one unless you're curious, since it's cheap.",0,1659332981,81,0,62

1274,1488540,"I really enjoy everything about this game except the actual gameplay.

It has great artwork, theme, soundscape and everything, but I wish it didn't have the run around picking up objects parts. Maybe it is a metaphor for the struggle of the main character, but it comes off as a cheap way of adding filler to an otherwise really interesting game.

I'll still keep an eye on this developer because, again, the artistic expression and ambition is a wonderful one.

1275,1488540,"So, objectively speaking, this isn't a very good game.

But I love it to bits.
I went into it thinking it would be something about cannibalism and human trafficking, just from the name and trailer, with some surreal aspects obv, and while I was a little disappointed it ended up being more about drug abuse than either of those, it still did a pretty okay job for what it is. Love the little character, not sure if she has a name or not, but she's cute, and the game overall has a really good sense of character.

That said, I'm not a huge fan of this style of game in general, and the little chases were fun up until the point where the enemies started teleporting, which I found to be a little cheap, personally, but in a game this low-stakes, it really doesn't matter all too much. Story is a little bland and delivered primarily through text boxes, and I would've appreciated getting to know our main character a little more.

(NOTE: I've only played to the bad ending, which is the end the game railroads you into, and intend to replay the game and go for the other endings at some point in the future, so it's entirely possible I just haven't sunk my teeth into the game enough and it actually DOES let us get to know her)

I'd say the game is definitely worth getting while on sale, it's not trying to be anything super flashy or reinvent the horror genre, it's a short RPG with a message about drug abuse and depression, and to that end, I think it more or less succeeds. Don't go into it expecting it to blow your notions of the human psyche out of the water, and take it for what it is, and it'll be a lot more enjoyable.

Finally, the translation isn't bad, but it's noticeable at some points. Never to the point of outright confusion, but sometimes the lack of polish in the translation can lessen the horror.

Overall, I can't bring myself to say this game is bad, even though all signs point to it - I really do love the art direction and atmosphere it brings to the table, if only the gameplay, plot, and storytelling were better, I think Decaying Delicacy could've definitely been something special.

1289,1488640,"As a man with slightly more than my fair share of hours on this marvelous experience, I believe I am one whomst beholdth the adequate knowledge to place a well thought out and honest review on this product. As previously stated, I have quite the record playing this game...and that is for a meritorious reason! This game...this formulation of bits and bytes of data, has amounted to even more than I ever thought possible in this feckless existence of ours. It has risen within me a purpose...a will to live. God blesseth this divine creation for the merits it has brought to my life...HUZZAH I SAY!! 
          ...however, my sweet and loving tongue has haste turned sour after discovering the secrets hidden beneath the assuaging exterior of this ""so called"" video game. As are most satanic revelations that exist within this world, ""Wholesome Slaughter™"" bears an immense evil masked under the cute and welcoming nature of innocence. It does not bring me even a sliver of joy to bring you this message, but as Proverbs 28:13 says: 

                  ""He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
                  But he who confesses and forsakes them will find compassion.""

It is my God given duty to expose this evil and bring this injustice to light. While the product itself may be a gift of God, the business practices of those at the top of the development of this product has been tainted by the devil himself. The CEO of this game has been brought up on some substantial charges. One such brave employee of his has come out and voiced the CEO's transgressions against him. Out of privacy and confidentiality I will keep this employees name a secret and instead refer to him as Billiam. Upon joining the team, Billiam was promised certain dental insurances. But to his forlorn disgust, when the time came for Billiam to cash in on his dental policy, the CEO of the company would go against his word and NOT brush Billiams pearly white teeth. What was once a brilliant white has soon become a shade similar to ivory as a result of broken promises and sinful practices. How pitiful. To this day Billiam has yet had his teeth brushed by the CEO and to add insult to injury, the CEO himself stands by this sentiment. I urge all who read to look inward toward themselves and think, what's worth more...my short term enjoyment...or my lifelong dignity.

I will leave you at that. 
Keep your purchases holy, and may God bless you all. Amen

1317,1488650,"Quick Description:
-Velocity Noodle is a fast twitch cyberpunk themed precision platformer that offers a blazing soundtrack and tons of challenging levels.  This is a speedrunners dream and has been a real joy to experience.  While at the moment, it doesn't offer a ton of content, it makes up for it w/ fluid movement and innovative mechanics that any fan of the genre will appreciate.

*Notes:
-I have completed the 3 chapter story mode and all of the Hard levels and it took me just under 3 hrs.  However, I've only managed to get a gold medal 4-5 times and I have a ton of chopsticks to find throughout the levels.  I have by no means mastered the fundamental mechanics as that will likely take many more hrs.  The dev mentioned that there may be more levels added in the future.

What's Good:
-This game reminds me a lot of Aeon Drive but I think that Velocity Noodle feels far more fluid mechanically.  Jumping, dashing, and throwing out your sword feels great.  There is close to no input lag in anything that you do.  This was one of my biggest gripes w/ Aeon Drive, so I'm glad to see that this game really nails this fundamental down.  It can make or break a game in this genre and Velocity Noodle gets a big thumbs up in this department.  
-This has an absolute banger soundtrack!  There isn't a ton of variety, but the songs that are offered are perfect for the tempo and speed of this game.  It's exactly the type of music you would expect in a hyper speed cyperpunk world.
-Both Velocity Noodle and Aeon Drive have very similar teleportation mechanics, but I think that the mechanic is utilized in a more innovative way here.  The dagger in Aeon Drive teleports you to it's destination, but you always need a platform to land on.  What makes Velocity Noodle special, is that you can essentially stay in air indefinitely once you have mastered this teleportation mechanic.  It reminds me of the mechanic introduced in The Messenger which helps you stay airborn continually.
-Although there aren't a ton of levels, the difficulty curve and pacing feel really good.  I'd say that the learning curve is a tad more steep than the average game in this genre, but isn't too intimidating.  The Hard levels are really fun and offer the most challenging and unique platforming sections in this game.  I suspect that they ceiling is extremely high though.  I've watched a few streamers and it looks like they are playing a different game b/c of how they have mastered the movement and mechanics.  

Could Use Some Changes:
-The game length is clearly the biggest con right now.  This is a game meant to be played over and over, but if you were to rush through the 3 chapters, avoid going for the chopsticks, and ignore the Hard levels, you could easily beat the whole game in under 2 hrs.  That is clearly not the intended way to play the game.  However, I'd still love to see another chapter or two in the future either added as a patch or a dlc.  
-The story is extremely limited and there is no voice acting.  This is to be expected from a solo dev in this genre, but it's worth mentioning as some players always expect a unique narrative.
-The camera moves as you move and jump throughout the levels.  It can feel jarring at times, especially early on as you are getting used to it.  I do believe that a patch has already been added that lowers the speed that the camera moves w/ the player.

Thoughts:
-This is my favorite genre and I'm a huge fan of solo devs that are trying to create passion projects.  Clearly, the dev has put a lot of time, energy, and love into this fast and fluid speedrunner.  It doesn't offer as much content or variety as the best in the genre, but it is a well designed, fun, and challenging game that won't hurt your bank account too much.

Consensus:
-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  I'm looking forward to mastering the levels and collecting all of the chopsticks in the near future.  I had a lot of fun w/ this game, but I'm not sure if it has the staying power that better games in the genre offer.

It's a hoop scoring game in which you get to pick one of 5 locations (Classic basketball court, space, Beach, Pyramid and a Night Club) and you can play 3 kinds of modes on each of them: Arcade (classic score hoops until you are board, but the basket keeps teleporting about the arena after each shot), Timeline (a set amount of time to score as many as you can) and moving which of course sees the basket hoop constantly moving back and forth. . There is nothing much wrong with this game and nothing right with it as well. Yes, it looks OK and has some fun environment, but it's too hard, it's full of bugs and there are far better basketball games out there most of which are for free. It's worth a look for something silly to play for 5 minutes I suppose, but you just about get what you pay for here which is not a lot.

1345,1488740,"UPDATED REVIEW:
This game is actually a lot better than I originally gave it credit for. After playing a lot of retro console and micro games recently, including a few blackjack games, it's impressive how full-featured this title is. It's as if Zaxtor took the time to ensure he implemented the rules properly for the game he is attempting to simulate, unlike many shovelware card game times of the past.

There are all sorts of unique occurrences too! There's a morality and karma system built-in to this game that plays into the risk/reward element of blackjack.

If you love blackjack but also don't want to sleep outside after gambling away the Christmas savings account, The Best BJ is your best option!

ORIGINAL FIRST IMPRESSIONS REVIEW:
Apparently my BJ skills are terrible, but Zaxtor99 is the master of the BJ. A fast-paced BJ simulator that didn't appear to do anything that would be in direct violation of the expected cards and some additional features were added to ensure that if you end up at $0, you can continue playing to try to dig yourself out of the hole.

This isn't anything overly impressive for the average gamer, but for someone seeking a blackjack simulator -- it's highly recommended. It even has an integrated leaderboard and achievements!",1,1637026133,6,0,489

To be fair the 6 different areas look good and some of them even look great and the 20+ characters also look good. But when it comes down to gameplay this game falls flat on its face. There is no skill here, no learning curve, in fact, apart from the first tutorial fight in the bar you won’t be able to win any more fights. Most the characters don’t even have fist models so you can’t make a fist, the “throwing items” thing is all but pointless and the powerups/special abilities are crap beyond crap and not explained in any way.

O and did I forget to mention that you can't turn your character avatar around with your joy stick...no you have to to turn your physical body around in circles to help your character avatar move and keep your opponent in eye sight, only the quest 2 is wireless and that is what you need to enjoy this game but it is so unbalanced and unfair.

With its nostalgic visuals, addictive gameplay, and captivating 8-bit soundtracks, it's a game that manages to strike the perfect balance between honoring the past and delivering a modern gaming experience. The game's commitment to delivering an authentic retro experience is evident throughout, making it a true treasure for fans of classic gaming.

While it may not introduce groundbreaking innovations, Beastie Land doesn't need to. Its strength lies in its ability to recapture the magic of old-school gaming and make it accessible to a new generation of players. If you're yearning for a trip down memory lane or simply seeking a fun and nostalgic platformer, Beastie Land is a treasure worth unearthing. It's a reminder that sometimes, the classics never go out of style.

Graphics (4/5)

The graphics of Beastie Land pay a heartfelt homage to the classic 8-bit era of gaming. It's a pixelated wonderland that captures the essence of the past while providing an enjoyable visual experience. The pixel art is charming and meticulously crafted, evoking fond memories of gaming's early days. The character and enemy designs are simple yet endearing, and the game world is filled with vibrant colors and imaginative landscapes.

While Beastie Land revels in its retro aesthetics, it doesn't quite push the boundaries of modern technology. However, this is by design, as the game aims to deliver an authentic 8-bit experience. The graphics successfully achieve this goal, immersing players in a world that feels both familiar and nostalgic.

Gameplay (4/5)

Beastie Land's gameplay is a fast-paced and action-packed adventure that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The core of the game revolves around addictive coin and treasure collection, a classic element of platformers from the past. As you navigate through the various levels, the thrill of collecting treasures and coins becomes increasingly enticing.

The platformer design is well-executed, offering a balance between challenge and accessibility. The controls are responsive, making movement and jumping precise. The game introduces a variety of obstacles and enemies that require quick reflexes and strategic thinking to overcome.

One notable feature is the absence of boredom; Beastie Land keeps the action flowing, ensuring there's rarely a dull moment. The game's pacing encourages continuous engagement, making it easy to lose track of time as you delve deeper into the treasure hunt.

Nostalgia Factor (5/5)

Beastie Land excels in delivering a strong nostalgia factor. It successfully transports players to the era of classic 8-bit gaming, evoking a sense of nostalgia that tugs at the heartstrings of those who grew up with pixelated adventures. The pixel art visuals, combined with the 8-bit soundtracks, create an immersive experience that feels like a genuine blast from the past.

The game's commitment to recapturing the essence of old-school gaming is commendable. It's a delightful journey that allows players to relive the magic of that bygone era while embracing the convenience and technology of today.

Creativity (3/5)

While Beastie Land excels in replicating the nostalgic gaming experience, it does not necessarily introduce groundbreaking or highly innovative elements. The creativity lies more in its faithful recreation of classic gameplay mechanics and aesthetics. The focus on treasure collection and platforming, while enjoyable, doesn't break new ground in the genre.

However, the creative flair shines through in the game's level design, which presents a variety of challenges and surprises. The incorporation of imaginative landscapes and enemy encounters adds depth to the gameplay and keeps it engaging.

Unique Gameplay (5/5):
""Beastie Land"" distinguishes itself with its unique gameplay concept. The ability to transform into various beasties adds an exciting layer of strategy to your heist missions. Each beastie has distinct abilities, from agility to strength, and choosing the right form at the right moment is the key to success. This uniqueness sets ""Beastie Land"" apart and keeps players engaged with its dynamic and ever-evolving challenges.

Stealth and Strategy (4/5):
Stealth and strategy play a significant role in ""Beastie Land."" The game encourages players to think critically, plan their moves, and outwit their pursuers. It's a delightful blend of quick thinking and careful execution, creating an immersive experience that rewards both cunning and daring approaches.",1,1694227543,268,0,23

1411,1487940,"The style of this game is what intrigued me about it but sadly that is about all it has going for it. It is in a very poor state for a $15 base price and Early Access in my opinion, here is my thoughts.

- No real story? The game pretty much just starts and throws you intro it with no introduction or any story elements really to speak of. You wake up, choose your starting monster and that is pretty much it. You then leave your house and pretty much wander aimlessly fighting NPCs.

- Monsters all look very plain and generic. They can't evolve, and you can't check any stats of these monsters either once they are in your party. You also can't check to see what any of the types are and can't see what any of the moves do. 

- Battles are very basic, as stated above you can't see what your moves do so you pretty much pick blindly. You can't see your own HP even it is just a solid bar so you just have to guess on how much you have left? You also can't switch monsters in combat so if you at a disadvantage in a fight you are screwed no matter what. The animations are all basic and they don't really have any sound effects either.

- The game doesn't have any items or an inventory at all, very odd in an RPG. You are only able to use a ""Capture"" skill that will allow you to attempt to capture an enemy monster. Other than that you can heal up at once center and that's it.

-No sound effects for anything, interacting, menus, in battle, transitions between areas. It all makes it very jarring. 


The game is relying heavily on nostaglia with its look and style and is severely lacking in features and quality, I can't reccomend anyone buying this right now especially for a base price of $15.00. It is in a very poor state for Early Access. Hopefully the developer can improve on this but I feel like the price for what currently is here is honestly kind of gross.",0,1613721419,11,0,9
1412,1487940,"Early impressions, it's Early Access alright. A lot is currently missing, items there's a menu but no items yet. The dex isn't ready yet either so you can't check info on the various Nuu. 

Visually it's great, than static sprites following you. Just a little animation would go a long way. And I would adjust the battle screen's ""floor"" because it's too close to the sprite colors in my opinion. Music is okay, I assume it's free from somewhere but it's not used well. It's just on a random loop rather than done by area, so there's also no combat theme. The loop is also done really poorly, so it cuts each song off awkwardly. It's just a touch that I think games need to bring in more personality to the world. May as well just shuffle your favorite game OST and there'd be no difference really.

Battles early on are very basic so far. One attack, one heal. It seems like every Nuu has this setup. Which can be a bit annoying at times with wild ones as they heal and you damage and just have to wait it out until you can finally whittle them down a pixel at a time. It's bizarre that the experience is only given by trainers. You can repeat the trainer battles though so that's nice. And you don't get forced into battle with them. Which could arguably  be good or bad, I personally like that. May just be something not yet added who knows.

There's a lot of missing battle effects right now, the dev says they'll be added though. So far I wish NPCs had a bit more personality, most of them have just been tutorial messages masquerading as NPCs. So it kind of makes the world a bit lifeless. 

It has potential. I personally am enjoying it. There's a lot of QoL features I wish were already in place, I don't see a way to tell if you caught a wild Nuu for example. I don't want to remember that. I'm hoping they add switching mid battle. I'd give it a mixed review if that were possible. I'm leaning more toward a positive than negative, but that's assuming EA goes in a positive direction. I'll change the review if necessary later on.",1,1613806860,55,0,370

1414,1487940,"While I like the aesthetics and a lot of gameplay decisions, I have to not recommend this for a lot of reasons. There are so many quality of life enhancements that are missing to make this playable. 

Most importantly controller support, or the option to actually move the windowed game. The fact that the menus are this restrictive and the game itself feels like you're unable to properly view anything from name to hp, to even abilities is beyond me. 

The entire power balance also seems really off, I had to grind two nuumon for about an hour to beat the second.. whatever they're called. Gym boss? Trainer that increases your elo? He comes with 6 of them that go from lvl 10 to 20, while my highest was barely lvl 12, and of course, weak against them. Not even saying that his 6th nuumon is lvl 20 and has a no-mana costing ability that drains your hp. 

Utterly ridiculous by itself, but some nuumon are also much stronger than others solely based off of stats. The crow is like twice as strong as the cat despite being the same level, as both the first and second ability massively damage and restore more health respectively. Also there are icons that aren't really explained like does the cats ability ""sharpen"" give you a damage boost or something since it has a sword (?) icon next to it? It sure doesnt feel like the attack afterwards is stronger.",0,1629192593,192,0,59

1424,1487940,"You know that feeling when you're craving something to eat, then you go out and get it, and your order was messed up? That's how it feels to play this game. This game is 3 years into their 6 month early access, and the last update was in November. It was for bug fixes. The last update before that was in 2022. Also bug fixes. There hasn't been a real content update in over a year, which is double what the Early Access was supposed to be. That should tell you all you need to know right there.

But...
I'm just going to discuss the problems I had in the first two areas... yes. That's all I played.

- There's NO run feature.
- When you go to capture something, it says your current monster's name instead of the one you're trying to capture.
- I've never failed at capturing something.
- The AI in this game seems to play for your side, using less powerful moves if it can kill you, and skipping attacking to use other moves if you're one hit away from being knocked out. These moves are used by wild monsters that when you catch them, they don't always have... I don't play games to be cradled.
- Your party screen is locked until you find coupon girls that give you coupons and you win it as a prize.
- The party screen doesn't even let you do ANYTHING but change the order of your Nuumons or whatever it calls them. You're not invested into a story that explains anything so I forget. The only way to view your stats (Yes, the screen exists) is by checking them during a fight. That's ridiculous! 
- There's things in your menus that say ??? for explanations, but in other menus have the explanation for the thing that isn't explained. Also, there's things that say they aren't introduced yet, but it's literally been over 6 times the length of their ""Early Access"" goal, so when is it getting introduced? 
- If you need to switch out your current monster, it goes to the next one on your list. You have to put your party together accordingly. This feels like a big mistake. All the areas I've been in have been a random assortment of monsters so there's no strategy in getting through them. There's almost no point in switching now, and you should just grind one up to walk through the game which gets boring really fast.
- There's no real explanation of what's going on. You talk to everyone and find out you have to grind to a certain amount of exp in order to fight an Elite Trainer. After you do that, you can unlock the next route. 
- When you beat the first Elite Trainer, the first monster in your party starts following you... What? No explanation, no reasoning, just have this weird concept added to your experience. I'm assuming the more you beat, the more your party follows you, because the trailer shows various lengths of monsters following you throughout. 
- Talking to trainers you already battled forces you into a fight with them again unless they're an Elite Trainer. This is very counter-intuitive to every previous experience anyone has had in a Creature Collector game, and I almost lost because I had to refight the fight I just did. It was my first fight and I had one monster with me.
- I intentionally died because I read some reviews after I tried this out, and instead of just a game over, now you restart in your room. I was two towns away by then. That's like fainting in public and getting taken to your house instead of someone taking you to the nearest hospital.

This game is wildly troublesome. If you're going to copy some else's work, you should at least keep the good aspects that are already flushed out instead of adding issues to be quirky. I feel like the reviews didn't go into much detail about their experience with the game. Maybe this will help make the game a little better, but I doubt it.",0,1709410879,41,0,65

- why switching your monster is in 'Special', and
- no way to switch your monster to your preferred one.

The puzzle part is exactly the same as in the previous games. Swapping tiles offers no challenge, little to no variation or quantity. Copy-paste level of effort to make this is too evident. 

The art seems slightly better than in the previous title but that doesn't mean much. It's still pretty pixelated and bleak. Even for this price you can find better quality. No excuses.

The electronic music fits the theme, so if you like this type it might be the best part of this game. I, for the most part, like this genre but sure won't remember it the next day. Too generic.

Excellent art and stage designs, good music, and a somewhat generic story that helps set the mood. Overall, a solid 9/10 and an easy recommend for anyone who are a fan of turn based, tactical RPGs.

A fun tactical RPG that feels reminiscent to older Fire Emblem games. Instead of hero units, or hero units leading an army (e.g. Fire Emblem Three Houses), your hero leads a squad of generic units of various types and attributes. This is the strongest aspect of Symphony of War - the ability for you, the player, to mix and match different unit types and create squads that are able to defeat different challenges. 

The units each serve different purposes: some are heavy infantry, meant to withstand the brunt of attacks, such as cavalry charges, while light infantry work best as ambush units, allowing you to take out key armies and even the playing field. Then there are the special units, such as mages and musketeers, who are powerful on the offensive, but often require others to protect them against counterattacks and ambushes. Each unit also has multiple upgrade paths, which adds to the incentive of experimenting with different units in different squads.

The game also features wonderful, animated pixel art for its units, something that I have missed greatly from more recent Fire Emblem games, and the soundtrack is good, though somewhat repetitive by the mid-way point of the game. The stages are also fun and sufficiently challenging, but not to the point of becoming frustrating. I rarely found myself having to redo multiple turns, and the fact that a ""re-do turn"" feature is included in the game makes the experience all the more enjoyable.

One of the weak points of the game is definitely its story, though it is by no means bad. Generic as it is (again, similar to the older Fire Emblem games), the story served its purposes in situating the player in the various scenarios the player finds themselves in, and it helps immerse the player in the role of being the leader of their band of merry men and women.

Overall, I would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys tactical, turn based RPG games. As someone who very much enjoys this style of game, and especially the ability to personalize your units, this was a solid 9/10 for me. But for folks who aren't really into TBRPGs and are more looking for an excellent story to carry them through the game, this may not be for you.

As an aside, given the solid foundation SoW is, and the fact that the DLC added content seemlessly to the game without feeling out of place, I very much look forward to seeing what other improvements and features they could bring to a possible Symphony of War 2.",1,1721678818,3548,0,45

Romance scenes are fairly simple animations of characters on top a photograph. They are OK quality. Not mindblowing but not bad.

Gameplay is a pretty interesting take on rock paper scissors. Only the first girl is traditional rock paper scissors, after that you play a game where each hand throw counts as 0, 5 or 10 and you have to guess the value of the throw. Each girl seems to have a bias as to what values they like to throw most, and the game keeps a running counter so you can see their running total. I have seen very obvious patterns like 20/20/60. On top of recognizing patterns, the game rewards you with drink tickets, which when redeemed give you a random card in your inventory. Cards give a 5-15% boost to one of the three values, and you can use one card per turn to alter their bias. After you win the card game you play the drinking game, which is a take on a classic bar coin game where there are x number of shots and each person can take 1 or 2 per turn. The person who takes the last drink wins.

1485,1487430,"It's alright not much worth saying, and I can understand why it got mix review.

Gameplay is fairly simple, you're just playing childhood games with bunch of hot anime girls like 'rock, paper, scissor'. And a drinking game after you beat each girl in their previous games. After beating them in two of their game you unlock them for some adult fun. The gameplay in general is not so hard but fairly challenging, with a bit of thinking you can beat the game with no problem. And for the story, don't even bother because I didn't catch what they're saying either.

The CGs are pretty bad and inconsistent in term of visual, like the girls' idle art are well done and nice to look at, but then we have a downgrade for some of the characters' animation. At least the more character you unlock, the more the art improve. But then there're also some anatomical mistakes on some of the characters make them look quite awkward, and that just ruin all the rest of the good parts of that character.

And one thing really annoy me is the BGM. Instead of choosing a bar/nightlife themed song for a game that about bar and nightlife setting, they would rather pick a song that sounds like 'go go happy sunshine' to blast at your ear all the time. It doesn't even need to be over the top club music, just chilling bar music is good enough.

This game also has some bugs, but not really game breaking. Mostly are just UI bugs and SFX bugs.

If you have some spare bucks and want to have some cheap fap, this is still a fairly ok game to get. But it's probably better to get a hentai puzzle game than this one. Or save up for something more worth it.",0,1713642727,143,0,198
1486,1487430,"Simple, budget puzzle title from Gemini Stars Games with mandatory anime lewds. Are your hands ready for this challenge?

As the description on the game's page says, this is a ""paper scissor rock like game."" All you need to do is win RPS bouts with girls, followed by a simple drinking match. The game is split into three sections. First, you simply have to beat the girl you find in the bar you enter. There are two versions of these encounters. You either play a simple RPS match or select a numbered card (0, 5, 10, 15, 20) representing the combined value of the cards selected by both players. In both cases, you need to win three rounds. Once you win, you still need to engage in a simple drinking match. Both players drink 1 or 2 shots until there are none left. The last to drink wins. Every win unlocks a h-scene with the selected girl.
After a few wins, the second section starts. Now you need to beat three new girls in any order, but you need to beat one of the previous girls before that to have access. In other words, you need to win two matches in a row. Similarly, every win with the new competitors is followed by a drinking match. Once you win, you unlock the h-scene.
The last section consists of six-player RPS battles and requires 20 drinking cards to open. You select one of the five opponents to play with, while the rest fight in the background. Every round there are three matches (yours and two between the remaining players), the outcome of which can be checked after the round ends. The number of cards players have is limited, and you can see the total number of cards players have, so you need to choose wisely which card to use. There are a maximum of 8 rounds, so you fight until only one player is left with cards or until you reach the 8th round. Here, you don't need to win the overall competition, just your bouts, which in turn will yield tokens used to unlock dates.
As for the difficulty of winning, it is moderate. There is a lot of randomness involved, but after a certain number of battles, you can notice a pattern. It shouldn't take a long time to win all.
To aid players during the first two sections, after every match, you obtain drinking cards. One card if you lose, three if you win. You can buy a drink for a girl with every card. Each drink gifted produces a random support card to use in battles. Some cards you get increase the % of the card your opponent will pick, and some offer the automatic win of one match. 
As you can see, there was some creativity involved to make a simple RPS game less monotone. For a budget title, it is fairly good, and there are 15 (20 with DLC) girls to beat and date. It's not the best puzzle game I've played, but I can't say I've seen anything similar. For the price asked, it is decent enough.

The anime art implemented here was very likely done by several artists. Since I played other games from this developer, I am familiar with most of the girls (if not all). Sprites (and even some h-scenes) were simply copied from other games. 
The quality of the character art is decent but uneven. Some girl sprites have weird body proportions and/or positions. All characters are lightly animated and can be clicked on during matches to interact with. Also, all h-scenes are animated, but just like the character sprites, the quality is uneven. Fortunately, everything is uncensored. You can watch all the unlocked scenes in the gallery. Additionally, you can pose and take photos of all the unlocked girls. Not bad for a budget price.

Music is fine. There are only a few different tracks present here. Simple, electronic tunes accompany the gameplay. Nothing memorable, but certainly fitting. Sound effects are ok. During h-scenes, there is some generic moaning but no music.

No bugs encountered.

Overall, a simple RPS and drinking puzzle game with some gameplay variations, decent artwork, and ok music. For the price asked, it is good enough. If you like similar titles or titles from this dev., it might be worth trying: 5.4/10",1,1702132013,240,0,237

But this port, it's just...utterly awful. I'd be here all day if I tried to fully explain every grievance, so instead I'll organize them into a quick and snappy list so you can see just how botched this was.

No keybinding
Mouse will become visible for no reason
Audio sometimes only plays from one ear
No mouse sensitivity options
Cutscenes are still at their original resolution, making them extremely low quality in this port
Menus are also still at their original resolution; I can literally count the pixels.
No proper exit game button, because the developers couldn't even be bothered to do that
Still advertising a failed battle royale game that hasn't been updated in over two years. Even the title is incorrect, calling it ""Gold"" instead of ""Royale.""

These are the issues I gleamed from only 0.2 hours played. Imagine all of the nonsense I'll find as I play more. I'm happy beyond belief that Battle Bears was brought to PC, but this port feels pathetic.

Edit: Beat the main story, and oh my goodness, the congratulations screen doesn't even cover the entire screen. I also figured out why the audio would sometimes come from one ear. As it turns out, the music is coming from the actual environment, right around where that dropship crashes early on. So depending on how far left or right you turn, the audio will be stuck in one ear. Why this is a thing, I honestly have no idea.",0,1610602794,73,0,76

Second and lastly (This is the only actual bug that I found) sometimes I found that some Huggables get stuck or just don't spawn in on random waves in a stage making it unable to beat the wave without exiting to the menu and resuming thus restarting the whole wave.

1509,1487460,"Bought this game after playing it when I was young on the earlier iPhones and I always remembered this game, so I was curious about this game when I saw it was on Steam, and it's an alright time killer. There's not much to the controls of the game, move the mouse to aim, Q to switch weapons, R to reload, and that's it. The story mode of the game follows Oliver who get stuck on a planet full of, ""hugables"" that will hug him to death, so he bunkers down and fights until backup can save him.

The story mode is 5 stages with 4 waves each and a boss after the 4th wave, the boss stage always introducing a new weapon for Oliver to use; also, after every stage, you have the ability to harvest 1 ammo type, or repair your bunker. Waves are fairly simple, and on the medium setting that I played on, there's only 4 enemy types the entire game. Pink hugables which are the standard enemy, they die to 1 headshot with the default weapon, or 2 bodies shots with the default weapon, Orange hugables which are like the pink ones but move slightly faster, blue hugables which are big tank enemies that require 8 shots to kill, and zombie hugables which only appear during the final boss battle where you gain an infinite ammo double barrel shotgun that is incredibly powerful and melts the zombies. 

Outside of boss battles, most items won't really be used. You don't take a lot of damage since aiming isn't too bad, though the cursor is super sensitive, so you have to get used to moving your mouse really slowly, but I found myself using the flamethrower until I got the swearphone, then the pot of gold once I got that. Though these items are mostly last resorts and not something you'll be using unless you're surrounded. Each boss battle introduces a new item to use besides the 1st one which you just use the default pistol for. Though the weapons used exclusively for boss battles that are able to be used afterward, I didn't find much use for them because the default pistol 1 shot headshots the entire game. 

Speaking of boss battles, there's 5 in this game. The first one is a barbershop quartet that's fairly simple, the 2nd a big juggernaut enemy that's actually a boss in the other battle bears game and the fight is okay, the 3rd (my personal favorite) is an aircraft carrier that's a massive unicorn, the 4th a werewolf bear that is fairly underwhelming, and the 5th boss is a giant tower that spawns zombies which you kill using the super OP shotgun until you kill 500 enemies, then the game ends.

This game is relatively short, I've already beaten the story mode, and the extra modes are pretty much the same with just regular survival which is just more of what story mode had to offer, and boss survival where you fight the bosses from the story mode again.

Ultimately, I picked up this game because of nostalgia, and in some respects this game didn't age that well, but it was fun to relive this neat little game from my childhood. 3 bucks isn't a whole lot, and honestly it's an alright game that's fairly short.

This included games such as Battle Bears -1 (Yes, that's actually the name of the game), Battle Bears: Zero, Battle Bears: Zombies, Battle Bears: Blast, and Battle Bears: Gold (which is a multiplayer game similar to Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch) However, the series' popularity began to fade into obscurity, and every game that was on the Apple Appstore, except for Battle Bears: Zombies, and Battle Bears: Gold was removed. So if you're wondering as to why this game looks blocky and looks like it came off of a Nintendo 64 cartridge, that's why.

Now, as for my opinion on this port:
When I found out Battle Bears -1 and Battle Bears: Zombies was ported to PC through Steam, I was excited, because the iPhone version of Battle Bears: Zombies is kinda broken, and Battle Bears -1 no longer exists on the Appstore, and I loved these games when I was a kid. Now, Battle Bears -1 on Steam is surprisingly good; they optimized it for PC, there's graphic settings, and the gameplay is just as fun as it was playing on the phone; it honestly feels like I'm playing a game that was made for PC. As for Battle Bears: Zombies, this unfortunately a horrible port and it's an insult to what made Battle Bears so good in the first place.

While Battle Bears -1 actually felt like it was remade for PC, this feels like I'm playing on an iPhone emulator or something. Here's a list of things wrong with this port:

1. The controls suck. The controls purely rely on the mouse, the only time you need the keyboard is for switching weapons and manual reloading. Also, Oliver, the character you play as, turns very slowly, which makes it hard to keep track of all sides on the battlefield. It would be nice if we could turn quickly like we could in the iPhone version.

2. The game glitches from time to time. I don't know if it's just me, but I ran into several glitches while I played through the whole campaign. The most notable one is when using the Slingshot, which shoots black jelly beans that cause the enemies to inflate like a balloon and explode, but in this port the inflation effect is broken and instead the models just distort, and there's not even a sound when they explode. Other glitches include Oliver's weapons going invisible for no inexplicable reason, or the sounds of the enemies dying keep playing on a loop, and sometimes the enemies get stuck in the ground or get stuck in place.

3. There are no graphics settings. You are not able to change the resolution, which is bad because I like to have my games set at a specific resolution. Don't get me wrong, I'm not gonna be too heavy on this, because this game was originally an iPhone game, so it makes sense that has a default resolution that can't be changed, but the option would've been nice. Battle Bears -1 has it, so why not this?

4. There's no quit button. I have to alt-tab to quit the game every time I'm done playing.

5. The cutscenes look ugly. Like I said before, this game was originally an iPhone game, so putting the cutscenes on a big, HD screen makes them not look good, but take a look at this game's trailer on the Steam page, the cutscenes look great! They look like they were actually remastered for this port, but when you play the game, it's just the cutscenes from the iPhone version. Even the tutorial video was taken directly from the iPhone version, and that version does not have mouse or keyboard controls!

All-in-all, this is a seriously rushed port, and because of that there is bound to be problems. I really do hope SkyVu is able to improve this version of Battle Bears: Zombies via updates, and maybe even port the rest of the Battle Bears series to Steam someday. Battle Bears is a series that has serious potential, and I don't want to see this series die, even if the fandom has severely shrunk down...",0,1691392139,89,0,26

first off i want to apologise for not touching this game soon as i should of as i didn't know that battle bears 1 and -1 got ported to PC since 3 years ago and i am deeply disappointed not just in myself but have dishonoured my bloodline


the game play of battle bear 1 is so fun as it makes a awesome game play loop. kill a bunch of enemies, new weapon, kill more enemies and then fight a boss round with a new weapons and repeat. the game is perfect it dosent have to over step because it just works and 0 expands off this loop to makea more creative and amazing game play loop. the music in the game really shows the brutality and struggle with the characters the enemies  throughout the game adapt trying to sneak up  on  you  through  coming  around the, Corners  flanking you, going to the sides,  and throughout you progress getting better weapons that makes  old weapons  redundant  like the and  pot  of  gold  (which replace  the  previous s aid  weapons)    and  adds  a  feel  of  progression  as  if  were  getting  stronger.  not  even  including  the factor  of  nostalgic  in the  picture  here.  the graphics  while  very  dated  are  still  good  and  a  little  bit  creepy . the art  style  also  really  helps  to  support  the  comedy  but  the story  as well  as  you  see  the  world  become  more  demonic a s  the story  progress  battle  bears.  while  the  game  is  very  limited  the  game  sets the foundations of the battle bears franchise. while posting this this review I've only played a little bit of battle bears -1 nut so far enjoyed it while these games are great and to sky vu thank you for porting these games i do wish to see ports of the other games such as battle bears 0 and gold (or is it royal? (and yes i will play money. the only thing i do have say about this franchise though is it soulless with he recent release of battle bears hero which to me just looked like brawl stars but with battles bears name on it (just saying i haven't played heroes or any battle bears game since 8+ years up until now and is again another sin will have to bear with)

to  conclude  with everything  i said  about  how  great this  game  is,  i  still   cant  give  battle  bears  a  proper review score as it will be too little to give to such a game and i'm not joking i'm being dead a**. i could say more but i don't want to write a whole essay but this is one of the best game ever ican keep going on and on.

It benefited greatly from being ported to PC, the shooting is incredibly more satisfying and enjoyable now for what it is. Not saying it wasn't on mobile, in fact it fit the device perfectly so of course it was. The cut-scenes are acceptable since it's just a port, which being at the time of its release were great. But only having to move the mouse to look around, shoot and reload instead of using two hands to do all three is so nice. Not to mention the soundtrack is amazing, The Barbershop Quartet's song (And how they are) is very memorable fitting enough for the time, the music is a banger, and kinda is how I got into rappers like Snoop Dogg. I'm so glad this game came to Steam, and someday I hope to see the rest of the series on Steam as well. I know you guys are working hard, so keep up all the hard work!

The game mostly reminds me of the real classic Rogue, but in 3D in first person, where you can get insta-gibbed from full health depending on what's found behind the door and the RNG. This might intrigue some players, but I just found it bland.

It really shouldn't be called a RPG at all because there's no story, no dialog, no choice, no characters besides mindless NPC's. There's no ""town"" hub, no proper vendors, no factions. You have a apartment, but the sole and only purpose to visit it is because there's a stash box there. Might as well just let players have a bigger inventory since you can teleport home from anywhere anyways.",0,1715873648,978,0,95

[b] What I Liked [/b]

Honestly, games like this don't come out that often.  RPG, grid-based, etc.  I tend to play most of them when they come out.  Also, StarCrawlers is still one of my favorite grid-based dungeon crawlers out there, and it's a sci-fi game.  So having another game in this universe is great.

The skill system is certainly unique.  Just pick a bunch of skill trees and go with that build.  Very daring way of doing things.

Otherwise, the graphics hold up decently.  They aren't incredible, but for randomly generated dungeons, they get the job done.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

It's a roguelike, but isn't.  It's hard to tell.  You could literally pick a build and beat the game on your first try.  Good chance you won't, but there is a chance you will.  Problem is when you die, you don't get stat points, etc. that carry over.  Nothing that gets you stronger for each run.

The skill system is almost too big for a game like this.  The problem is certain trees won't work well with one another at all, and the skills aren't explained in the best way to know exactly what they do at all times.  It's a monster task, and while it's done decently, it's not great.

The UI is rough, very rough.  The game isn't designed for ultra-wide.  While the game does display in ultra-wide, the UI doesn't seem to like it.  Even if it did, the UI elements aren't that great.  I can move them around, but they don't look good.  Same with inventory management, vendors, etc.  The UI needs to be cleaned up.

While I get it's the purpose of the game to clear out reach floor, I would have loved just random missions to do in between the main storyline.  Sometimes I just want to hunt loot without caring about the story or progressing it.  Progressing felt forced in this game.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I really think this game needs another year to get polished.  It's decent in its own right, it just needed to sit in early access longer.  I made the buy to try it and because StarCrawlers is a great game.  I bet this one will be too, just don't expect it to be anything like StarCrawlers and don't expect it to be great until sometime in 2025 or so.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!",1,1716235510,595,0,325
1574,1487560,"I like this game it keeps surprising me.

I see a lot of others mentioning it draws from roguelikes, and I think that's true. To be clear, rogue-likes not rogue-lites. Games like ATOM or Tales of Maj'eyal. It's a grid-based dungeoncrawler, with a very unique feeling Turn-based FPS combat akin to games like Superhot. Much like those games, you have a huge list of skill trees and builds to experiment with. And these trees have no ""+5% damage"" garbage. It's all interesting and gameplay changing.  Equipment also often times comes preloaded with interesting and build defining abilities. Everything I've seen so far has been amazingly well designed. Permadeath exists but is off by default.

Also like those games, opening doors is terrifying. Situations get ugly quickly and proper planning and response is critical. The developers are clearly aware of this quality and implemented a stealth mechanic giving you a couple of turns after opening a door to decide how you want to engage. There are tons of abilities, outs, and strategems you can employ. It's a really well designed game in that regard.

Further like those games, it EATS time. The game centers around climbing a giant corporate tower and each floor can take an hour. I'm only like seven hours in, and on floor five... on floor one there was a locked elevator with the number 83 on it (and other lower elevators). I... can't even imagine what that could mean as far as my life this summer. So far, the floors have all been incredibly unique, with chemistry labs, production centers, cyber-spider infestations, training floors. Much of it has unique mechanics to the floor as well. Seems like there are some long term deep secrets to find too.

The bad? Sometimes grid targeting is a little fiddly (or doesn't show up at all). And sometimes enemy AI breaks. In both cases, sometimes favorable and sometimes unfavorably. Performance has been great up until my current floor which chugs a bit (for good reason though! The developers went kind of all out on this floor and its kind of awesome!)

I see lots of people complaining the story is non-existent. Yes and no; compared to their previous title, which was much more traditional rpg, yeah it's quite barebones. Especially regarding you and your motivation and role in all of this it doesn't really say much. Usually all you get is a mysterious figure offering you prizes for tasks. But I will say there are some really flamboyant enemies and NPCs you meet. Yeah I, like the others, was a little disappointed it's all not as well contextualized in some kind of overarching narrative though.

I bought this because I was a big fan of their last title and wanted to support the devs. It's not the same thing of course, and I think that's fine. Chase your vision Juggernaught. I'm really glad this exists.  Like it said; it keeps surprising me and I want to see what happens further up the tower.

1575,1487560,"For now, I am giving this a tentative positive review. No, it isn't Starcrawlers (and I would love to see a true sequel to that game), but Starcrawlers is probably the best first-person dungeon crawler that has been released in the past several years. This game is a single-character, first-person roguelike in the Starcrawlers universe. I find it engaging because it shares some mechanics with dungeon crawlers, provides a good sense of progression and build diversity, and it has a solid loot system.

I didn't look at any walkthrough and simply played the game as I liked which ended up with a bad ending with Souichirou (took me roughly 4.5 hours). I definitely did not expect a hearbreaking ending and bawled my eyes out at the end. Since then, I went to read up more on this game. To my delight, there is a total of 19 endings. The happy ending for Souichirou will only be available after you have passed all happy endings for the other 4 guys. I have yet to read the remaining walkthrough given that I would much prefer to explore on my own and see where my choices will lead me to. I saw quite a few comments that the plot and character growth are not that good due to the removal of R18 content. However, given that I have no idea on the original version of this game, I do not think the lack of R18 content affects the game play for me. I would highly recommend getting this game!

Was so excited for the game that I got it despite mixed reviews now that it was reported most of the bugs were fixed.

Pros
- Extremely cute aesthetic
- Excellent visual character design
- Interesting ""combat"" mechanics

Cons
- Couldn't bring myself to finish the game - full disclosure
- For a personality-assessment game, offers very little control over your bug's personality
- Socioeconomic commentary lacks necessary depth, deeply disappointing and frustrating
- For a game pretty explicitly about emotional intelligence, it's absent.
- Frustrating bugs and glitches around quest progression still exist
- Visual glitches periodically (like my bug friend's face disappearing)
- Combat is never explained in any depth, which isn't the end of the world, but it also gets tired pretty quick. 

Since I didn't finish the game and requested a refund, please keep that in mind with my review. I followed this game for a long time in its development and was SO excited for it, played the demo, etc, so perhaps my disappointment is impacting my perception.",0,1721332085,136,0,8

    [*]The Devs are super engaged with there community!
    [*]The game already has a ton of content!
    [*]The art style is really nice and easy on the eyes!
    [*]Thought a limited soundtrack, its good whats there!
    [*]Game gets regular updates almost every day!
    [*]Extremely customizable gameplay!
    [*]Very easy to run, and super responsive.

That's not to say its perfect!
There are a bunch of annoying things in the game.
But none of them are game breaking (so far)

[b]Things that's ""annoying:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The game suffers from poor translation!
    [*]The stages are not very well balanced!
    [*]The menu is a bit cluttered and cumbersome!
    [*]The tutorial is to brief and don't cover enough!
    [*]Way to little information on how things work!
    [*]The first couple of stages are to hard, and can scare off new players!

For all its flaws, the game devs are there to help and fix issues as soon as they can.

If you find a bug or any other issue, just post it in the community discussion forum,
and the devs usually replays within 24h (and also releases a patch fixing it)

Seeing as the game has only been out on steam for less then a week at this point.
The game is heading in a great direction.

This has potential to be one of the best Tower Defense games on steam, it just needs a community to help work some things out :)",1,1621967477,6261,0,4
1587,1487680,"Colourful, balanced and big Tower Defense, with a huge arsenal of towers and plenty of maps. 

[h2]Level up! [/h2]
Broken Universe is an experience based TD, where you have to level up in order to unlock towers and technologies (talents). This has a great impact of coping with the difficulty. On my playthrough I started on hard, until the point this wasn't feasible, so I continued on normal. 

[h2]Choice overload [/h2]
There are many towers and technologies to choose between. A bit too many in fact. After 120 hours I roughly used about half of the towers. You can upgrade your towers, which costs resources. So it's hard to try out different towers because they always start off with an inferior tower. I'm not sure this system improves the game. 

With the technologies there is a similar problem. For every level you get 1 technology. You can gain extra by clearing levels on the hardest difficulty, and by clearing on challenge mode. In challenge mode you assign 4 traits to monsters, which makes them more powerful. 
You get technology points up to level 40. At that point you can choose roughly half of the technologies, which forces you to choose. Technologies have a great impact! There are four trees, attack-defense-utility-construction. But you don't have enough points for attack+defense. I mostly went for attack+utility, and for one map with lots of towerdamage I went for defense. You don't kill stuff, but your towers survive as well. It's awesome to cater different playstyles. Unfortunately it's a hazzle to swap technologies. The game could use the ability to swap specs quickly, such as selecting a technology in the tree, and everything until that point gets researched automatically. The developers are very active in polishing the game and are involved with the community, so I expect this to change. 

[h2]Conclusion [/h2]
What drew me initially to this game is the very reasonable price. I usually play something from my library, but I happen to see this game. The game is very 2023 with good animations, and it has a catchy tune with a thematical variation for every world. 

The game has a bit of the depth and merry colours of the Bloons games. However the animations of this one vastly outrank the monoform balloons. 

I very much appreciate the fact that there aren't achievements for perfecting the game on difficult. Right now the game feels casual, and since your arsenal can always be improved by endlessly grinding, I think the game has to remain casual. So this game might not be for the absolute diehard TD players. Sadly the scoreboards are swamped with cheaters. A great way for some VAC-bans imo.

In the beginning even Wild difficulty is okay and you can have fun with that then you go to the next map and even Standard difficulty feels bad. I would think that Standard is the difficulty that you can see the whole game with it.

I feel like that the monsters and towers need more tuning. Damage, range, price and so on. Because some towers feel really weak or too slow.

User interface should be more PC-like and not this touchscreen version. If this was put on mobile devices first i would understand that but its here so it should look like the part. 

Some positive is the graphics and the cute look of things. Also what i've read the developer(s) seem to listen to players so thats a big positive thing too.",0,1632159211,1557,0,39

In new version levels are longer: you have more time to plan and build, overall pacing became better and game no longer feels too short. Less story is a good change as well. After replaying from fresh save-slot i must say, the difficulty is just great. That's the level of care and dedication we deserve in 2021 and i am proud there are small indie games like Broken Universe and Drox 2 where developers are literally in love with project and can share their passion with us.[/i]


(Old version)
Review is neutral, more to negative, but it would be unfair for, reasons...

[h1]The good[/h1]
First of all, Broken Universe reminds me ""Go Home Dinosaurs"" and ""Beware Planet Earth"": it's just a pleasant to eyes and heart, with a lot of love put in - you can feel it from evey corner. Visuals are great, they resemble ""Kingdom Rush"", but have unique style. Levels design is good, player feels freedom of choise and has a lot of customisation. There are many towers, not an extent of ""Primeworld Defenders 2"", but just enough to put it over many other games, even outmatching ""Dungeon Warfare 2"" and ""Orcs Must Die 3"". And cheap price. For an early access game, this is impressive list of goodies.


[h1]The meh[/h1]
I don't like childish story at all. Yes, this is Tower Defense, can't really expect Game of Thrones from it, yet i would rather have no story at all instead of cringy stuff between plushy animals. Also there is too much dialogue. I would prefer something like ""Atomicrops"" or ""The Tone Rebellion"", where you get an introduction and that's it. 

Levels are very short, just 60-90 seconds to beat, where you don't really have enough time to build anything big or even use 50% of map. Lastly, difficulty is easy, you can put few basic guns and use enviroment to win levels. And 'hard mode' feels more like 'normal', while challanges even easier than hard mode, not sure bug or intended.

Overall those meh points can be fixed over time. Right now researches, skills and merge towers making it even more easy and feel like cheats instead of proper mechanics. 


[h1]The Negative[/h1]
Way too much, way too fast. Player gets overwhelmed with different rules, buttons and mechanics. UI takes a lot of screen space. Just to read through basics it will take a hour of time. Monsters and towers have plentora of different stats and it's hard to keep up with everything. Each next level unlocks even more stuff and you just get very angry. 

While there are additional hard modes, the only difference is monster hp, armor and attack. I would rather prefer difference in level's geometry, some extra obstacles and rules, different waves or even unique creatures.

No randomness. Sadly, there is nothing like random runes drop or tower parts. You beat the stage, now move on, never return. Instead of giving us something interesting to grind for, game just puts it bluntly: go farm extra coin and exp to buy even more 'easyfication' upgrades.

All stages withing one planet feel the same, have same music and pretty much same-ish monsters. A slight difference in visuals would be nice. While there are biomes in Kingdom Rush series, yet every level presents fresh looks and even interractable stuff.

No achievements. I haven't seen any special quest / missions to complete for bonuses or secrets. Feels aimless.


[h1]Worth it?[/h1]
So the final question, should you buy this game? Yes. For an average player this is a good find, even a rare diamond. But for person who seeks something unique and fresh, it's a no. Broken Universe is competitive enough to shine brightly against fattest TD projects and we don't really have many good games on the market today. But this is just classic verison of old idea without anything special to it. Also over-cartoonish looks causing to feel like this is mobile project or something more suitable for browser, even tho it definitely has higher level of quality.

So, yeah, neutral review.",1,1631263443,2499,0,540

1594,1487680,"Highly recommended if you're looking for a good classic tower defense. It is fairly difficult for a TD, but thats a plus in my book. Theres alot of variety as theres many towers and in the end of ch 2 you get the ability to further customize them. Enemy variety is also pretty good and each tower has a use depending on the map and enemies that show up.

Only downside is some towers targeting doesn't work well with the provided options. Lasers for instance are best at firing down a line and on default ""closest"" they have maybe 1 in 5 chance to fire down a line. On ""low HP"" they will target correctly about half the time if you set it up so low HP targets are where you want to fire. There is a fusion tower that fixes this though by shooting 3 lasers instead.

Theres also a nice improvement to the maze design that you are allowed to block every path and they will try to break through the closest. I don't like to play this way, but sounds solid with ceratin defensive setups. Also theres an anger mechanic that will provoke mobs to attack closest structure or blocked path (with certain mobs being more likely to aggro) so you have to be careful putting a squishy tower in a key chokepoint.

Anyway theres alot of content and its pretty fun. Though be prepared to adapt to the map!",1,1674802894,289,0,27

The levels are quite short, only a few minutes long, and that's one of my complains. The gameplay is very fast, there is no much time to think, you have to act very quickly. But it is still one of the best TDs out there. I hope that the devs will do something to slow the gameplay down a little, maybe even 25% would be enough.
Also the complexity of the game is getting higher as you progress which is great.

I'm really enjoying this game.

I've been I think a pretty hardcore TD player for over a decade.
This game does it. 

Couple hours in, I can see there's dozen of hours of enjoyable content and farming.

The fact you strategically chose your base starting point, earning more reward while having many difficulties, while mazing, is amazing ! 

The games actually seems balanced. Every upgrade does a little but a little goes far.

Again, couple hours in, I can see the complexity of mazing, choosing your towers deck and spending wisely your ressources, it's gonna be worth it to invest in.

The only thing I feel could have an 'upgrade' is the 'hud' feeling. Maybe something more of a ""base' or 'village' to visually make it more intuitive to navigate through the different upgrades 'tabs'.

Overall this feels like a great game. A great TD. No time wasted, directly to the poin t while being pleasant, complex, 'difficult' and creative.

Once you hit level 30, progression becomes a bit grindy but there is always something to do, some new scenario to play, some daily mission to do.

This game is freakin' weird. It's like they originally designed this to be a mobile gacha game and decided to instead refit it to be a full release game. It's visible from the menus, from the stringent tutorials, from the upgrade system and the resources, just everything.

In a lot of ways is it reminiscent of ""Kingdom Rush"", but Kingdom Rush wasn't exactly the best in terms of interface either.

Its short, sure, but one of the largest issues with VR games is they're trying to get too complicated too quick. That's why games like Super Hot, Pistol Whip, Beat Saber, Job Simulator, etc do so well. 

This game has two button controls, grip and shoot. Reload manually by gripping ammo on your belt. The simplicity lets you truly get immersed and just focus on the game. I would honestly love to see more like this game. Maybe even a cinematic or semi rail shooter where you choose where to go and what to do but your engagements are either stationary or locked movement. Like a modern Time Crisis.

My friend and I bought this expecting a different experience (in the way of different enemies map or something similar) but this DLC was a let down, granted it does exactly what it says (in that it allows you to play multiplayer) but instead of having the co-op being paid, they could've released that for free to get more players and then they could've release new stages for money because the same map with the same enemies is kind of boring...

[b]-- PROS --[/b]
- it was fun at first (in that it was cool to see my friend in the game alongside me).

[b]-- CONS --[/b]
- It's the exact same map and enemies.

[b]-- Conclusion --[/b]
- Paying for multiplayer isn't the way to go (IMHO) for games like this, playing alongside friends and other people makes the game more exciting and help to keep the game alive for longer. The game isn't bad by any means, as an introduction to VR games, it's great but the paid co-op (with no new additional content) feels a bit meh....",0,1613260192,0,0,5

Visual, sounds, animations, everything is super high quality. The gameplay is also perfect and incredibly fun: although simple, it is exactly what you want for a multiplayer zombie VR shooter. Each wave adds an element of surprise, keeps the fear level high, you feel entertained and under pressure.

I've found areas i can't enter like the castle on the mountain, and i've found 2 types of humans, 1 that runs away and the other that picks me in a cage, so cute. And 2 types of Troll one that is active in the night, very scary and deadly, and the other that appear during day, it picks you up, but i managed to get away because it was slower then the night troll. But I'm really stuck because I don't know how to get back to the gnome village lol. This game really needs a map or a compass. Getting lost is really easy, but I love it. I'm also now level 4.

That there seems to be a story to it also is a nice addition I was not immediately expecting. also from the road signs and the time it did take me to reach the first village, I get the idea that the world is not small. unfortunately I get simsick very easily and having to switch to first person to interact with things (like food) makes it difficult to play long for me (that being said the fact that there is a easy to adjust 3rd person mode just by using the scroll wheel of my mouse is great and something I think is missing from many other games). the very small mouse pointer in red makes it very difficult to see where it is, it would be great if things like the mouse pointer and the text colour could be changed.

It's not a bad game at all, but is early in development and every element of the game is very rough. I am no expert on Unity, but it also feels very stock-assety. This is common in early access games and stock assets are usually placeholders replaced later. So this didnt put me off.

1760,1487800,"Man, I adore this game.  This game is in its early stages, but it's already very promising, and the dev is constantly putting out new, significant updates, and with each one the game noticeably improves.  In the meantime, the core ethos and atmosphere are already pretty much there.  The big hook for me was walking through the woods, navigating by signs along the path, and getting that tingle of adventure down my spine that I associate with being a kid playing Morrowind.  The sense of a magical, alien world to explore and discover is already very much intact, and I have no doubt the dev will continue to flesh it out.

As far as its limits right now, they're the standard ones that come with it being an Alpha--some janky animations and appearances, some things just feel awkward, missing QoL features, etc.  If you want a complete, playable right outta the box kind of game, this isn't it, it's very much actively in development and if you jump in now it's likely your saves will be broken several times before the game's done.  That said, if you saw the screenshots and video and were immediately captured by the concept and world, that much is there for you right now, and indications are currently very strong that the dev will continue with consistent updates and improvements.  Know that you'd be paying for an Alpha, but also know that, as Alphas go, it's a pretty good bet.

Also, I just wanna say, I really like that your gnome is one of the skinny little red-capped variety, looking almost like a toy, as opposed to the stout, bearded garden gnome look.  I don't think this game would work for me half as well if I were playing as a garden gnome, but somehow the skinny little guy is just the right balance between shades of cute and of creepy.

Anyway, because this is released as an Alpha I've reviewed it as an Alpha.  Many features are not yet implemented, but there is a playable core.  What's there is not perfect, but it is constantly improving.  And finally, if you're really in doubt about it, think about your original reaction to the screenshots or video--were you immediately intrigued by the world and the concept itself, before knowing anything about mechanics?  If so, I'd say this is worth a buy.  However, if you're after a feature-complete survival game first and foremost, this is not that.  It's functional in that aspect, but there's clearly a lot of addition and refinement to be done.  Animations and models are somewhat rough right now, but those are being improved from one update to the next.  If you like the world and you can spare the twenty bucks, go ahead buy in, see how you like it, but if you're here for the mechanics, wait til it's had a little more time in the oven.

Personally, I'm trying to avoid playing too much now, at least for the span of a few major updates, so that when I come back to it, it'll be that much richer and closer to complete.  I happen to be interested in seeing it grow, so I don't mind being an early adopter, but again, if you're looking for a finished, polished game, this isn't that.  If, however, you're looking for a unique, intriguing, and above all promising Early Access game to put twenty bucks' worth of faith into, then this is that precisely.

So glad I found this weird little gem.  Every time I see this game has a new update it puts a smile on my face.

Trading is always bad for the player, as new pieces are hard to come by while the AI has an endlessly-growing army.

I love dogs. Driving dogs around while getting them snacks and toys sounds like the perfect VR game to me. Unfortunately, this game is awful. It received public funding in Brazil. The Brazilian government needs to investigate where those funds went because they did not go into the development for this game.

The assets look like they are taken from one of those low-poly dollar store bundles you see everywhere. The music sounds like it was taken from DRM-free sources. The driving mechanic in this game is one of the worst I have experienced. You use the joystick to navigate the vehicle. The vehicle turns painfully slow. It feels like you're driving a tank on the road. 

There are 6 stages and I finished 4 of those stages in about 15 minutes. I could have done 2 more stages, but i just didn't have it in me to keep going. I'd rather watch paint dry.

What you see on the trailer is what you get.
I was expecting some basic editor.
Is not good enough at this state to ask for money, wont ask for a refund because I do hope the tool is polished to a level where my opinion and hopefully review changes.

The TL:DR is that is not woth money because is not polished enough, lack basic features.

The app doesn't let you edit the texture, nor load custom textures to create some custom dress in multilayers, like a 2D editor.
The app basically only has around 10-12 dress presets, which are very similar.
Can't even edit the colors beyond another 10 color presets.
There's some basic stickers to add to the model and edit it, but couldn't find a way to set their color, except the global color preset.
VRM characters from a disk file made on Vroid is totally buggy and useless, seems the only possible model that works is the one that comes by default, which only has 4 haircuts presets.
Japanese is not a big deal if you know basic kanas and most of the app is easy to guess icons and almost no japanese text.

Leaving my review here in hopes the developers improve the app.
Pls fix the VRM model import and allow a bigger customization and editing of the model.

tl;dr lacks cohesion and will break your expectations - which aren't inherently bad things, so try the demo if you're curious

Ochitsubaki is a very experimental story. For a reader, it is unrelentingly honest, perhaps brutal: other than an English translation being provided for non-Japanese readers, it feels like the author gives no quarter to reader convenience, telling the story exactly how they want to with little guidance. Poetry is mixed with modern slang is mixed with untranslated Japanese, with no explanation - indeed, who said there had to be? It's a refreshing way of telling a story, to trust your readers to do due diligence.

By the end though, I felt that Ochitsubaki suffered an awful lot from its incoherent presentation, and only skipped through on my second read. It's also a bit steep for such a short story (and worse, it might be a target for Steam refunds). I don't recommend the game for those reasons and because it didn't fit my expectations. But this is a weak recommendation. If you enjoyed the demo AND like indulgent (?) romance, you might give it a go.

---

(Bit more expanding on my experience with the game, potentially including light spoilers.)

I feel Ochitsubaki plays a lot with cohesion and expectations/norms. The early presentation feels mostly cohesive: ancient Japanese-sounding music, a lush purple-gold interface and starting with a poem gives a sense of the themes you can expect. But juxtaposed with Sailor Moon-esque pixel art and its refusal to hold the reader's hand, it becomes unusual and fresh. Pretty unique style. In any case, the demo (first English chapter) engaged me and I purchased to because I'm a sucker for flowery Japanese stuff and the description shouting ""bilingual"" had me wondering how exactly the dual script was handled.

I read the Japanese script first and felt let down by the storytelling. It omits much of the poetic flair the English has, and is a fair amount shorter. Then upon reading the English script, the difference in tone caught me off guard. The poetry gives way to explicit scenes that I found hit-and-miss. The style choice was apparent to me - English written one way, Japanese another - but by then I had already lost interest. I wonder if I would've had a different experience if I had read the English first.

The demo is so cool and engaging, it ended up setting expectations for me that the rest of the game didn't manage to meet. I'm disappointed in the game but also in myself for not pushing to see it through... buuut that's not how enjoying a book works.

1848,1486440,"I was thinking I wasn't going to enjoy this game on the premise alone; a game where the entire focus is grazing to attack back? Surely this means the usual shmup thing of overtuning the amount of bullets so that cancelling the entire screen or being invulnerable all the time becomes a mandatory chore (cough psyvariar), or is so hard you have to use it like Akai Katana. Thankfully, Graze Counter GM (called GM because it is a remake of the original game, but on GameMaker) is a highly accessible and polished game that I can recommend to any skill level. Hard and on is about what you'd expect from the genre, but easy and normal are still great for easing you in and figuring out the mechanics before you start being tested. It's rare to see a game that lets you see all of the content without asking you to do insane perfect runs. 

The main gameplay mechanic other than moving and shooting is the graze counter, essentially once you're close to bullets your ship will charge up a laser that can cancel anything in front of you. You can fire this laser at any charge, but full charge will give you an invincible shield while the attack is ongoing. Canceled bullets by the graze counter will fill up a burst gauge that acts like a hyper mode, boosting your regular shots but ending if you use another graze counter. This is the basic loop of counter > hyper > until you have to counter, which picks up in pace as the difficulties go on. There's good visual aid to help you see when you're being charged by bullets which is the thing I was worried about.

The thing I didn't see coming was the amount of characters; there's a whopping sixteen. Four of them will be the standard graze counter > hyper loop with different shots and movespeed, four of them will be a reversal of the mechanic where they use bullets to hyper > graze counter (hilariously broken), and the other 8 are all sorts of things, including cameo ""ships"" from other games entirely. You get them by simply beating the game with a character from the last set, so you can just run the game on easy a lot to do that.

1861,1486580,"Disappointing, though not unexpected.

I purchased this the day it came out (today) and was quite excited. Though I dislike IVECO buses intensely, sometimes that can be the best way of determining the quality of a simulator product, by seeing if driving the bus in game stirs up a deep down burning hatred.

This sadly, does not.

The models are absolutely fantastic. Like most of the buses in Bus Simulator 21 they look great, and the modelling department should be really proud of their work. The buses feature a brilliantly detailed exterior and interior which really do look good in the game.

Unfortunately like one of the popular train simulator developers, this is where my praise ends.

The physics are just garbage, though to give Bus Simulator 21 credit, it's consistent across the games range of vehicles. I do not feel like I am ""simulating"" driving a bus at all, rather playing a game, which is okay if that's what you're looking for.

But then we come to... the sounds...

Unless i've missed something, they're ALL recycled off current buses! This is a new DLC for crying out loud. It's an absolute smack in the face to paying customers, the people who support your game that you cannot be bothered to go out and record some real sounds of the buses you're selling to us. 

All in all, unless you really can't live without the IVECO bus pack in your game, I wouldn't bother. Maybe on a Steam sale perhaps?

I like Bus Sim 21.

Before we get into arguing discussing physics, THIS is Bus Simulator 21, IF I want to play a more ""REALISTIC SIMULATOR"" I will play my clunky, buggy, old graphics on Omsi 2. I own most of the DLCs.

1867,1486580,"IVECO was incorporated on 1 January 1975, with the merger of five different brands: FIAT Veicoli Industriali (with headquarters in Turin), OM (Brescia, Italy), Lancia Veicoli Speciali (Italy), Unic (France), and Magirus-Deutz (Germany).[3]

Following the merger, the newly founded IVECO began rationalizing its product range, manufacturing plants, and sales network, while keeping the original brands. From 1975 to 1979, the IVECO range included 200 basic models and 600 versions spanning from 2.7 tons of GVW for a light vehicle to over 40 tons for heavy vehicles, as well as buses and engines.[4][5] In 1977, the light- to medium-weight IVECO Zeta range was introduced, replacing the 20-year-old OM Lupetto. Integrating the FIAT-OM range with the Unic and Magirus lineups was completed by 1980.[6] IVECO moved in to work on increasing productivity and engine development.[6] In 1978, IVECO launched the first product in the range of IVECO-branded light vehicles, the Daily.[7]

In 1980, IVECO built a turbo diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles.[8] In this decade the corporate strategy was heavily oriented towards brand promotion and led to the sponsorship of sports events, such as the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, the Davis Cup in 1982, multiple championship boxing matches, the Jacques Cousteau expeditions in the Amazon basin in 1983 and the Raid Pigafetta, during which the IVECO-FIAT 75 PC 4x4 was first to make a full circle of the globe.[9] Two new divisions were also formed: bus diesel engines and firefighting vehicles.[10]

In 1984, IVECO launched the TurboStar,[11] a heavy on-road vehicle that became a best-seller in Italy and also successful in the European market, selling a total of 50,000 in seven years.[12]

In 1985, IVECO made the first light diesel engine with direct injection.[13]

From 1986, IVECO S.p.A. held a 52% stake in Iveco Ford Truck Ltd, a joint venture (and effectively a merger) with Ford of Europe's truck division. Ford plants took over production and sales of the major vehicles in the IVECO range and continued production of the Ford Cargo.[14] In the mid-1980s, Astra Veicoli Industriali, which produces dumpers and construction site/quarry vehicles in Piacenza, became part of Iveco Group.[15]

In 1989, the first diesel engine with EGR to reduce polluting emissions compatible with commercial vehicles was produced, and the new Daily launched that same year was fitted with it.[14]

In 1990, the group purchased 60% control of Spanish industrial company ENASA, which owned the industrial vehicle builder Pegaso.[14] In the 1990s, the EuroCargo, EuroTech, EuroTrakker, and EuroStar vehicles represented a total facelift for the range.[14] The EuroCargo and the EuroTech were named ""Truck of the Year"" in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and for the first time, this recognition was awarded to the same manufacturer for two years in a row.[16] English company Seddon Atkinson was purchased in 1991 and brought its long heritage of special vehicles for the construction and refuse-collection industries.[17] That same year, the first TurboDaily assembly line was inaugurated at the Nanjing Motor Corporation in China.[18] In 1991, IVECO announced that they were withdrawing from the North American market at the end of the calendar year; they had been selling the midrange Iveco Euro there since 1978.[19]

In 1992, IVECO took over the primary constructor of industrial vehicles in Australia to form Ital, originally called International Trucks Australia.[20] In 2000 it was renamed Iveco Trucks Australia Limited.[17] In 1996 firefighting activities in Germany were structured under the company IVECO Magirus Brandschutztechnik GmbH.[21] The following year, these activities were boosted by the arrival of an Austrian company, Löhr, which then became Löhr Magirus.[17]

In 1998, the Cursor 8 was launched, followed the next year by the Cursor 10, the first diesel engine with a variable-geometry turbine and the first common-rail diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles.[21] The 125th anniversary of the presentation of the first Magirus ladder[22] was celebrated together with the delivery of the 5000th Magirus aerial ladder produced since the Second World War.[21]

In 2003, IVECO entirely bought out Irisbus, originally part of a joint venture with Renault.[23] In 2004, the IVECO Motors brand was introduced, which became an umbrella for the production of engines; the following year, it was incorporated into the newly founded Fiat Powertrain Technologies. At the end of 2004, an agreement was reached between Iveco and the Chinese company Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SIAC).[24]

In 2006, Iveco sponsored the Winter Olympic Games in Turin with a fleet of 1,200 Irisbus buses.[25] The year after, IVECO became sponsor of the All Blacks, New Zealand's rugby team.[26] In 2009, IVECO became the truck and commercial vehicle supplier for the Moto GP,[27] together with the historical sponsorship to the Ferrari Racing Team, for which it supplies the vehicles that transport the single-seaters at all the Formula 1 World Championship races.[28]

On 1 January 2011, Fiat Industrial was formed, incorporating CNH, IVECO, and FPT Industrial.[29] In September of the same year, the Fiat Industrial Village was inaugurated in Turin, a multipurpose centre belonging to Fiat Industrial and created for the sales, assistance, and product presentation for the IVECO, New Holland, and FPT Industrial brands.[30] On 15 January 2012, IVECO won the 33rd edition of the Dakar Rally with the Petronas De Rooy team and Dutch driver Gerard De Rooy, behind the wheel of an IVECO Powerstar. De Rooy was followed by drivers Stacey and Biasion behind the wheel of two Iveco Trakker Evolution 2 vehicles, equipped with an FPT Industrial C13 engine with over 900 hp.[31]

On 11 November 2021, Iveco published the prospectus in order to split from CNH Industrial which will be operated as a publicly separated company named Iveco Group N.V.[32] After the completion of the demerger, on 1 January 2022 IVECO became a part of Iveco Group N.V., the parent company of the trucks and specialty vehicles, powertrain and related financial services businesses previously held by CNH Industrial.",1,1665096742,0,0,98

You take on the role of Red, a bodyguard for hire, and he has been commissioned by Hannah, a servant of the Heinrich noble family, to accompany and protect her master, Lady Claudia Heinrich, as they travel to the north for vacation.  What is unusual about this assignment, though, is that nobles usually travel south for the winter.  However, Red accepts the assignment, as he wants to earn the money and save enough to build his own home and obtain a peaceful life.  What secrets lie where Red and Lady Claudia are going?  I'll end my story synopsis here to avoid spoilers and all that.

As for the gameplay, this is a visual novel, so there are choices presented that determine one of two endings.  Basically, [i]Flower in the Snow - Resurrection[/i] is divided into two parts.  The first part is the common path, where choices are presented that lead either to Claudia's or Ling's (the maid at the post in the north where Claudia is heading) path.  The second part is either Claudia's or Ling's path, which plays out like a kinetic novel.  There are a good number of CGs as well as Chinese voice acting.  Also, this visual novel can be played in either English or Chinese.  (For purposes of this review, I'll be commenting on the English version.)  In addition, there are Steam achievements although no Steam trading cards at the time of this review.

Now that I've gone over the story and gameplay, I'll move onto my critique.  A bit of a heads up, but for those who regularly read my reviews, this one will be written slightly differently from here on out, as I'm hoping that the developers and/or publisher will take a look.

[b]Pros:[/b]

There are a lot of aspects that I adored about [i]Flower in the Snow - Resurrection[/i], but I'll start off with the story.  I liked playing as Red, the bodyguard.  As I got into the story, I learned about his past, which tugged at my heartstrings.  He's a strong character despite the horrors of his past he endured.  Also, I like the cast of characters, especially the two main romance interests - Claudia and Ling.  They are very different, one being a noble and the other being a maid, but something ties them together, which inevitably results in conflict.  Although the story is mostly narrated from Red's point of view, we do get snippits into Claudia's and Ling's pasts, especially once on their paths.  The side characters are great as well, and they add to the story's dynamics.  On the story itself, I really enjoyed experiencing it.  It's mostly an adventure story filled with fights (there are minor scenes with blood, so be aware of that), but it also has romance, which I wasn't expecting.  However, the romance feels natural and I'll say that it has been a while since a romance got my heart to flutter.  XD  

On the art, it is absolutely gorgeous.  The sprites are well done, and the backgrounds are beautiful.  Now, the story does take place in the snowy north, so we do get a lot of those scenes and it makes sense that they tend to be beautiful.  Still, the art was wonderfully done, and the CGs are lovely to view.  

Now, I'll comment on the voice acting and soundtrack.  It isn't common to hear Chinese voice acting in visual novels although thankfully, more of them are showing up on Steam.  I'm not familiar with Chinese myself, but I'll say that the voices were lovely to listen to and I really liked that the entire cast (except for Red) was voiced.  There are even some nice sound effects like howling wolves.  The soundtrack is beautiful to listen to.  There are a variety of tracks, and each one captured the mood of the scene it's placed in.  The tracks vary from a happy, everyday life to a tragic mood.  

[b]Cons:[/b]

Ok, now I do have a couple of negatives that need to be pointed out (and I really hope that they get fixed in a future update).

First, I noticed a bug when the game transitioned to flashback scenes.  Sometimes, the lines of the scene would run to the bottom of the screen to the point where I could only view the top half of the words.  I had no choice but to use the backlog function in order to read what those words were.  I don't know if this is a bug with the game engine, but this should be fixed.

The other negative I have to point out (and perhaps it's the editor in me) is the lack of editing for the English version.  Now, I do appreciate that this visual novel was translated into English, and I really must praise how beautiful and captivating the story is.  However, it was a struggle for me to read most of the sentences.  There were run-on sentences, typos, etc.  I even noticed that there might have been a couple of instances where the translation was questionable.  Although I understood the basic gist of the story, it really needed a native English speaking editor for polish.  If it had been edited, I would even consider this visual novel to be perfect in my eyes.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]

Overall, would I recommend [i]Flower in the Snow - Resurrection[/i]?  Despite the issues that I described above, I would say yes.  I truly enjoyed the story although the English version needs editing.  It's a visual novel that I want more people to enjoy, but the struggle to read and understand it brings it down.  I hope that the devs and/or publisher hire someone to edit the English script.  Then it truly would be perfect, and for the asking price, it's a bargain.  (I'll note that the Chinese version might be perfectly fine, but as I'm not knowledgeable in Chinese, I cannot comment on this point.)",1,1612525929,561,0,233
1870,1486690,"I recommend this VN!

It's about medium length, a mix of action and romance with an emphasis on story. There's two characters you can romance. As for the assets- the CGs are good, music is pleasing, and voice acting is great as well. Oh, and the opening and ending movies are great too!

Only downside I can mention is that the English translation is a little iffy. You'll notice some typos and other grammatical errors here and there, but thankfully it doesn't impede on anything- you can still understand the story and what's being told to you.",1,1647017175,187,0,51

Being a bodyguard can be difficult, especially if you don't know the purpose of your presence, except that you must protect the employee...

In this game you will follow the life of Red, employed by a noble lady called Claudia, as you are known as someone who will kill those who endanger your employer.

I will say it clearly, I did not finish the game because it was boring... The story deals with Claudia's family's past and especially with someone who wants to kill her. The story itself is acceptable and sometimes what Claudia says is really interesting, for example, she says that recording things on the canvas ""is like building a gravestone for your memories. That way I can forget without regret"". Painting something is a way to express our memories and feelings in a timeless way, so we can remember them later...

She also said that ""life is like a snowflake"", which is true because we live and die without anyone remembering us, we appear quickly and die just as quickly.

One of the main reasons I stopped this game was because of the DA... The game is ugly... except for the CG which is incredibly beautiful. I thought the game was beautiful because of the CG and so I didn't pay attention to the overall look of the dialogue... So, be careful if you want to buy this game because only the CGs are beautiful.

The BGM are acceptable but can't be supported for too long. Like I said, I didn't finish the game so I can't fully comment on the game but from what I experienced, I don't think you should buy this game because... well the story isn't that good even if it's a bit philosophical and... yeah the DA...

At first you are not too impressed but suddenly the difficulty goes through the roof. I actually had to halt playing until the speed setting appeared in an update, it gets that nasty. With time (almost) on your side instead of millimeters the game becomes playable. You can see there has been a lot of thought going into the level design. Even if some levels have you millimeter jump for a hour on repeat, 9 times out of 10 it's just something you didn't think about. You almost have fun, getting through a level becomes a feat, even with the (too) few savepoints. And then you hit hell... every level is a nightmare. Even the devils laugh after getting hit by your blood.
This game needs a walkthrough... and my kid promised to do that... after he stops crying around level 78 or so.
Update: After finally beating the game (40h grandpa style) I should add that the last 30 levels were much more thematic and playable (can't say more to avoid spoiling). The last 10 were even fun except for maybe the hardest level in the game (on 100% speed).",1,1689875461,2881,0,11

1897,1486790,"Portal Mortal among many possibilities is a puzzle platformer. Controls are snappy (no floating) and hit detection seems pixel-perfect. The're are no loading times between (frequent) deaths, which gives gameplay a superb fluidity due checkpoints. Player is introduced to new mechanics as they progress the pre-made levels, and they feel natural as you progress. 

Game has multiplayer and different multiplayer maps, eg. capture the flag and deathmatch.

I have a 32:9 monitor (super ultrawide), and the game has no problem detecting and handling the resolution (it launched straight out the box 32:9, I havnt fiddled with resolution settings).
New areas are hidden until you progress unto them, and thus the common problem where you can see ""outside of bounds"" doesn't occur.

(KB+M) As mentioned before, controls feel great. There is a controller support, but I havn't tested it (yet). I'd imagine that aiming portals would be relatively difficult with a controller compared to kb+m, but platforming more enjoyable. Which brings me to my next point:

Level editor!
You can create your own levels!
You can create levels with your friends!
You can create and edit levels with your friends. As you play them. On the fly!
This opens a huge amount of possibilities! Your mate found a skip in your level? Slap a laser in front of him! A jump is too easy? Replace landing block with an ice block whilst they're midair! They're taking too long to perfect the running speed for the jump? Create a timed trigger which melts the ice block!

I do not at all understand what the other pieces are doing, can do or will do. I understand some pieces are supposed to be rooks, bishops & queen. I have no idea WHO they are. The little indecipherable video tutorial is useless. I cannot see a difference in any of the pieces in the ""help"" video. I do not know WHY pieces shoot, how they shoot or when they can shoot. So it is impossible to know if I am making a correct move or not. Why does the gun go off when I am 3x3 squares away diagonally but NOT when I am 1 square away horizontally. I'd think shooting the bad guy in the face would be an option. Guns do work at point blank range. As there are no instructions I cannot recommend this game. In fact I find the lack of any instruction at all as to the goal or mechanics that I can honestly say I think this game is absolutely terrible & no one should waste even a single dollar on it. If you can be bothered to put up a bad video attempt at a tutorial then you can also have a simple text screen explaining the goal of the game is to avoid capture, shoot enemies or capture the flag.

1936,1486840,"[i]SantaCraft[/i] is a short and sweet Christmas themed game that could prove to be the perfect choice if you’re looking to play something seasonal. It’s a sandbox game in which you take the role of Santa Claus, looking to recover his lost reindeer and sleigh and prepare for the upcoming holidays.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2679436833
The game focuses on collecting resources by mining the blocks that the world is made of and crafting all sorts of items by combining them in your inventory. The resulting products are then used to solve quests or simply to build your own Christmas town around the North Pole. Every sandbox element is adorably Christmasified: snow blocks cover the whole map (and you’ll have to dig a path through them), the trees are gingerbread cookies, the rocks are made of chocolate, the minerals are lollipops or candy canes and you fish Christmas taffy out of water spots. With these basic resources combined, you can create either the tools needed to harvest them, or some other intermediary items, and ultimately  whole buildings or decorations for your North Pole town.

The map is reasonably large - neither too big nor too small - and is very rich in resources, therefore you will not have issues finding what you need; none of the materials required for crafting are rare, and the durability of the tools is extremely decent. The resources can also be infinitely replenished at the end of the game by talking with a certain NPC.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2679436729
Some of the NPCs are the ones who stole Santa’s reindeer and sleigh and in order to recover them you’ll need to complete the quests they give you (it’s usually gathering certain animals, or crafting specific items). There are 14 of these main quests and 15 secondary ones - plenty to do to keep you busy for around 2-3 hours. The dialogues are witty and entertaining, filled with word jokes and subtle laughter.

At the end of the game, when all the quests are complete, you can continue playing indefinitely, harvesting resources and expanding your Christmas town. Apart from several types of elf houses, you can place all sorts of buildings (bakery, workshop, library, ice rink etc), connect them with roads and decorate the town with Christmas trees, gifts, garlands, lights. These are purely cosmetic though and there’s no production chain involved. This year’s update brought new mechanics to the game, with the addition of trains, train stations and tracks. You can even ride the train between stations and change the direction at the intersections, it’s a very cool feature.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2679436603
Aside from having the necessary tools for harvesting resources, you can also discover various equipment items, each of them giving you a special bonus. These are automatically displayed in the action bar when equipped and you can quickly cycle through them by clicking on the corresponding icon. There are also some funny items to collect that act like Easter eggs - for example a radio that can change the pitch of your background music when interacting with it (and 8-bitifying it).

Overall, I greatly enjoyed my time spent in SantaCraft, despite the fact that the game does not have achievements at the moment (I’m still hoping that they will be added in the future, even though the developers [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/1486840/eventcomments/3191360100902900446/#c3191360100906864668]mentioned[/url] that their team is composed of 2 people only and their time is really scarce). It’s a pretty wholesome game at the modest price of $5 (with lots of replayability value as well), and playing it was for me as cozy as sipping a mug of hot chocolate on a cold winter night.

I saw Santa Claus at a grocery store in the North Pole yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “Huh? Huh? Huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Gingerbread Cookies & Candy Cane in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first, he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical interference,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning loudly.",1,1703211343,16,0,46

1971,1486840,"""Santacraft"" is about what you'd expect given the name -- an adorable Christmas-themed game centered around making things, the ultimate goal being to save Christmas. You craft tools to harvest seasonally-appropriate resources like giant candy canes, chocolate rocks, and gingerbread trees. You can also go fishing for saltwater taffy. Sometimes, you'll find bonus special items while harvesting, like gumballs that can also be used for crafting. 

To save Christmas, one of your goals is to build a village, complete with a toy workshop and houses for the elves to live in. A lot of the buildings you can craft are cosmetic and not strictly necessary to complete the game, but nevertheless I very much enjoyed building a well-rounded village with a library, toy store, candy store, bakery, clock tower, park, skating rink, and all sorts of decorations. You can also place train tracks and stations to travel. It's cute to watch the elves run around your village, and if you click them they've got something to tell you.

Another goal is to find characters around the map who've held your reindeer host-- I mean, who will very kindly return your reindeer in exchange for favors. There are also a few optional side quests, and clothes to find that give you perks, such as faster resource harvesting.

The game takes just a few hours to finish, but it's the definition of short and sweet. I can see myself making it a tradition to play through every year. It exudes Christmas spirit.",1,1673313358,273,0,34

Winter is my favorite time of year. A time when families get together , have Thanksgiving, it hopefully snows, pumpkin spice foods and drinks are everywhere, toasty fireplaces are lit, and Christmas lights get hung. To be able to craft in the snow not just because it's winter but you're on the North Pole is such a joy.

A terrible blizzard has ravaged the North Pole, destroying Santa's village and scattering the reindeer and elves. As Santa, you must gather resources to rebuild in time for Christmas.

Players can make the village as big as they want so long as they have the resources, and although there's a lot, there does appear to be a finite amount with pear trees being the only renewable resource.

Is there a ton to build? Not really. There are several buildings, but even that's limited.

I had a relaxing time playing, but the gameplay and music, which is enjoyable, can be repetitive, and children may get more out of this than adults.

If you have any kids who want to get into the Christmas spirit (a little late as of writing this), and you want to make sure they play something safe, this is a good game to let them play.

I frequently had the orb glance of a corner and start bouncing sporadically and unpredictably, as well as the orb getting glued to walls as it travels along them, or simply get stuck in a random corner. Even without all these bugs, the game doesn't have that good of level design, and unskippable dialogue at the beginning and end of every level makes the game feel really slow for what should be a fast paced platformer.

Probably the complaint that kept popping up most, the little orbs that you have to get to the objective for the level don't behave in any kind of consistent manner. Most of the time they bounce off a surface, but sometimes they'll hit something and slide along it (at least for a bit) instead. The first time it happened I thought ""Oh, maybe that's what that difference surface texture indicates"" but nah. It might be intended to happen there, but it happens other places that have no visual tell.
The other complaint is that they seems to have put in this bit of... impact to landing from jumps. I'm not sure if it's a deliberate design choice or just due to it being an unoptimized game, or what, but you don't seem to be able to smoothly jump, land, and go right into another jump.

2037,1486080,"Time Master is a puzzle game that ensures a proper brain workout for the day. The puzzles are, unsurprisingly, based around time manipulation; you collect all crystals in a given field by first recording some first step actions and then letting the previously recorded 'you' do whatever you made it do while your present self goes off to benefit from the recordings actions. 

The hurdles put in your way during various stages vary from collapsing bridges to one-time activated switches, boxes, spells, ice and slight platforming. Most stages have a couple ways to approach them, but often only one route will be the most efficient to ensure getting the highest ranking for each level.

The challenges are fair, though it may at times be easy to get stuck as new levels may require you to think of  new approaches to previously used hurdles. Luckily if you're extremely stuck, but don't want to look at a walkthrough for the level you can get hints by joining MorpheusZ's discord or, I'd imagine, even by tagging them on twitter (latter option not confirmed, I know this developer to be extremely reactive there as well!), though sadly these hints aren't also implemented in the game itself in more than rerouting you to the discord.

Either way, do highly recommend the game. It floors me to know that this was a one person passion project considering how polished it is. Especially graphically this is an extremely nice game to look at and the animations, too, are very smooth. Story may not blow you away with its twists and turns, but it is always appreciated when one is there to spice an already pleasant experience.",1,1642879842,351,0,14
2038,1486080,"TL;DR:
9/10
- Made me smile, made me rage. Hallmarks of a great puzzle game.
- 30 seconds on one puzzle. 4 hours on another. 100% achievements 15 hours later
- Tried my best but still needed helpful hints from the devs in discord for 2 puzzles. 

""THiS IS hARdER thAN IT loOKs""
""PeRhAps...""
""wHat tO dO""

You know you're invested when the idle animation sounds feel like annoying taunts because you're taking too long. (seriously, had to mute the game, was ready to punch Zeno.)

Took me 15 hours to get all achievements (beating the story would take [i] significantly[/i] less) so I can definitely say it's a puzzle game with some depth. 
If you're in it for the story, you'll probably have no problem getting through it all as the game only turns [b]hard[/b] after you've gotten significantly far into the puzzle count. Hard enough to bust out paint for planning and spend 4 hours on a single puzzle. [spoiler] For me, hitting T46 was like a unforgiving spiked brick wall when I practically sped-ran and aced each puzzle before that. Also fuck T48, it was the puzzle that made me crack and search for hints. [/spoiler] 

If you enjoy elements of playing with time to get to victory, this game hits it out of the park. Although you will have to get used to quirks of the game which can be maddening. Some times instead of simple mechanics it can turn into an agility game of jumping and fighting to move a box in the direction you need fast enough. And not everything adheres to the laws of time, but you'll get used it and carry on. [spoiler] bridges magically falling without touching but boxes stop falling when pausing time?

2039,1486080,"《Time Master》 is a level based, puzzle solving game that requires players to utilize time rewind mechanics to solve each puzzle.

As players progress through each level, challenges becomes more and more difficult in terms of 'depth' (number of steps required to complete a puzzle) and 'width' (new mechanics appears in the puzzle). 

After 20+ levels, the layout of the map may seem daunting at first glace, however, every iteration of trials and errors leads players to get to know more about the map and eventually, should easily identify the bottleneck of the puzzle and solve accordingly. 

The gameplay experience could be described as an interesting mind activity, where players trying to figure out the developer's creative thought process and comes to admire the cleverness hidden beneath the surface level.

Besides the puzzle design one other thing that caught my attention is the soothing music, which is exceptionally well-made and suit the pacing of the gameplay very well. 

My only complaint will be the camera angle - due to the perspective of the camera, it is sometimes hard to see whether 2 cubes are aligned or how far away from each other. Although the game allows players to rotate the camera 45 degrees one at a time - it is still kinda annoying to press the button several times to get to the 'right' angle - a degree-free mouse movement to control the camera will be a more intuitive way for me personally. 

I bought the game with the expectation to immerse myself into interesting puzzle solving journey for 1~2 hours, which the game definitely delivers in this respect. Hence, I gave 《Time Master》 a recommendation.",1,1642768734,126,0,6

Forward planning is needed to complete the puzzles which increase slightly in complexity as you continue each level. You get a chance to learn fun and new mechanics and then discover these in different variations as you move through the game, remembering what you've learnt before to complete the puzzles.

The default control scheme worked fine for me and the game does a pretty good job of judging your intentions and avoiding accidentally falling off the level.

See what I did there?

No, but seriously: Time Master is a solid entry to the 3D Puzzle game genre, delightful for both casual players or hardcore completionists. Casual players will enjoy the calm music and the plentiful challenges the puzzles present; hardcore completionists will enjoy the thrill of finally achieving that third star through not only solving the puzzle, but through perfect execution -- this game makes you work HARD for that third star at times, in a way that is a bit unique to the genre given its unique ""paradox"" mechanic, which allows time to truly be of the essence (and the essence, likewise, to truly be of the time?). 

Because you unlock new challenges whether or not you ace a level, however, there's always something to step away to if you find yourself getting overly frustrated with any given puzzle. I do think there's room for a skosh more leeway in terms of that third star at times, but because the game makes time masterfully tight, it's deliciously rewarding when you finally succeed just before the second rolls over.",1,1642569530,82,0,7

Frames can get a bit choppy on big animations, but it's got a beautiful visage, and a sound track that fits it. It has a very calming vibe, which may be necessary due to the high amount of brain you'll be needing to solve some of the puzzles within. 
It's relaxing and it makes you think outside the box.

I stopped at the point where the solution was clearly to wait a while before triggering a switch that would block your path. I don't mind puzzles like that in concept, but in execution sitting around and waiting isn't fun. This was compounded with the fact that the time rewind makes you watch the entire animation rather than just warping you to the begging. This wouldn't bother me if you got to stop your rewind where you'd like to, but it always resets you to start. As a whole it felt more like a simple proof a concept but not what I'd consider a full game. It gets bonus points for having good music but gets another mark down for not being optimized.

The controls are not precise enough to consistently, accurately perform the tight timing needed to three-star some of the levels. This is because your character has no grid movement constraints in what is basically a sokoban puzzle game, making it very easy to misalign directionally-specific operations and mess up a run. In later levels this becomes extremely aggravating, and turns the gameplay into as much of a racing game as a puzzle one. Optimizing moves in a game like this is one thing, but trying to cut milliseconds off your time by finding the perfect flow where you have omni-directional movement becomes tedious.

2057,1486080,"I'll start with the bad before mentioning the good:

First of all, the story isn't anything special and the cutscenes aren't the best. If you need a good story to go with your puzzles, this might not be for you. Of course, most people come to puzzle games for the puzzles, so that shouldn't be an issue for most people; and admittedly, it has its own charm to it :)

Second, there are some levels where the difficulty comes from not knowing about an interaction that exists. When you have to do something you've never done before in order to solve a puzzle, something you didn't even know you could do, and there is a lot of other things going on in that level as well - it can be a bit frustrating. If you want hints, you have to go to the creator's Discord server, which might also be a turn off for some people.

That said, I still recommend this game, and here's why:

The levels, unlike the cutscenes, look very nice and have a lovely charm to them. They still aren't anything outstanding, but I found them quite pleasant.

And of course, the puzzles themselves; most of them (see above) felt very satisfying to solve and optimize. The mechanics in the game work nicely together, and it feels great when it all comes together and you hit the finish platform right at the last second before you would've ran out of time to get all three stars. The quality of the puzzles is the most important thing for a puzzle game, and among the 60 levels (plus a ""boss"" level, so to speak) you'll be having a good time for a very large majority.",1,1647994683,777,0,10

I wish I had found more ""non-indie"" games capable of creating puzzles the complexity of this one. The developer really put his mind to the test to create awesome combinations of scenarios and elements to create the most curious scenes for puzzle solving. And the fact that you have to ""do the puzzle twice"" to get things going it's a real ""double trouble"", and will keep you at bay more than once. Do not worry if you find yourself speaking in loud voice saying ""but if I pass through here, the past Zeno won't be able to cross...oh"", it's normal once you reach a certain point.
Apart from the concept itself, graphics are amazing, both during gameplay and cutscenes. Voiceover, sound effects and music are also of great quality, and will delight you without being too noisy or annoyingly repetitive.
There is certainly no aspect which can be harshly critisized.

Also, on big maps, a little spike in FPS can be noticeable, but it's nothing that would make it unplayable at all. one could discuss a few more things with the devs, but nothing as major, just small bits of what a gamer would like to see to polish even more a jewel like this.
An overall very entertaining game, with hours of interesting puzzles, nice graphics and audio, and a very interesting idea to even exploit it further in the future. Well done,  MorpheusZ!",1,1644444177,342,0,7

Time Master pulls you in with a simple but emotionally compelling narrative, then smoothly transitions you into a tight gameplay loop of collecting shards alongside your temporal doppelganger in an attempt to narratively secure resources to rescue your sister and from a meta perspective, get that sweet third star that signifies that you perfected the level.

It took the lateral thinking puzzles I loved in Braid and added another dimension(literally and figuratively). No surprise, but temporal puzzles in a 3-D space get spicy. It claims to be a relaxing puzzle game but that's only if you want pass the levels. If you want that third star it's going to make you work for it, often requiring you to not only have a time-optimal solution, but to execute the platforming with scant margin for error.  At no point did I tune out, I was too busy thinking of different iterations that might result in the synchrony required to eke the last few fragments out of a level and the sense of accomplishment that came with it. Once the novelty feels like it might wane it slaps another element or alters some of the gameplay to shake things up.

[b]Naughty Memories: Asian Beauty[/b] is a lewd memory game with an ""asian"" theme.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Flip cards and find matching pairs in a race against time! There are fifteen levels total, with progressive difficulty. As the game progresses, less and less duplicate pairs will be provided; you'll have to build a stronger memory to find each pair in time. You have a minute and fifteen to complete each stage, but each match garners three additional seconds. There is no ""skip"" button, but I think some users would appreciate one!

[h1]Story[/h1]
There is no story (and I'm not making one up!)

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
There is no titlescreen -- it's straight to the level-select screen, which doubles as a gallery. The user-interface is alright, though I don't understand the grungy, neon aesthetic. You can mute audio from main menu, but there doesn't appear to be any display settings. Apparently, the developers [b]still[/b] haven't figured out how to incorporate Steam UI. When viewing CGs, they cannot be fullscreened, and the user-interface isn't hidden. 

[b]- The Goods -[/b]
There are fifteen static CGs featuring naked, [i]asian[/i] ladies. They are imposed onto portrait-style canvases. They are rendered using 3D models, not unlike those of Daz Studio. Overall, I think they look alright! Maybe not ""hottest"", but [i]sexy![/i]

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
If you've nothing better to play,[b] Naughty Memories: Asian Beauty[/b] isn't a bad buy. This game has meaningful gameplay (which [i]isn't saying much[/i]), but the artwork is below average. With that in mind, this game will only appeal to gamers that [b]thoroughly enjoy[/b] memory games (and want to see the offhand boobie). I don't think [b]Naughty Memories: Asian Beauty[/b] represents a siginficant improvement on the developers' behalf. They have been improving on the quality of their models -- but at the end of the day, [b]Naughty Memories: Asian Beauty[/b] is another memory game with subpar content.

2118,1485860,"*There has been a patch since my review that will likely invalidate it. However I haven't had time to go through and try the game again. I will still leave this here for comparison to the current game and see what's changed and what still needs polish/refinement*

Only reason I currently recommend the game is because I'm a sucker for monster MC and can see some potential here.

However, that's all it has going for it, and it barely even does that, let's break down what the game has.

Pros:
Reincarnation system- unique from other rpgs I've played, offers the promise of different playstyles and advancement.
Progressive skill system- the more you use a thing, the more proficient you get at it (in this case you just get better ""equips"" that fill a slot related to skills in name only. Basically use things to acquire gear)

and that's about it for pros.

Cons: (Oh boy, where do I start?)

Choose your flavor of damage- elements and reincarnated form mean nothing in this game, physical and magical damage seems largely the same the entire game, nothing is weak or strong to anything. Only exception I found is Behemoth seemed to have perfect physical defense and required magic to beat, or ailments.

Stats mean nothing- Specifically focus and dexterity, these stats had no visible impact to the game whatsover, ailments would always land when used and turn order seemed to be affected by level more than stats.

TP- Nigh useless, you only get 2 abilities for this and come so late into the game and do so little that you'll forget it exists. The abilities are also about as strong if not actually weaker than your normal skills.

Reincarnation tiers are severely imbalanced- In tier 1, you're lucky to get or 1 or 2 stat points per level in all of your stats, including hp and mp, which made cp investment important for your progression. This was fun and exciting. However, once you hit tier 2 reincarnation, your stat gains and base hp and mp are so high that you curb stomp the entire the game upon hitting level 5. I never had to use CP at this point, as my stats were in the several hundreds by the time I got to the final bosses, of which they were level 80. I couldn't even fight enough normal enemies to accumulate to reincarnate into anything else to attempt reincarnation tier 3 before the game was over.

Farming- Useless in its current state, fish will keep your hunger up the entire game, they are plentiful and easily cooked at the fireplace to master your cooking skills as well (not that you need them). You do not get enough return on investment for trying to get the livestock roaming around or for planting seeds farms.

Story- Story is generic as one can get, but if you're purchasing a title with a name like this, then generic is probably what you're looking for. That said, the way it's delivered through only beating bosses and being horribly edited really leaves a lot to be desired. The story is also definitely in heavy need of a proficient english reader and speaker.

Fame System- never even comes up, you supposedly acquire fame for defeating adventurers out in the world, but the 3 groups you find never get harder, nor have dialogue, and do not incur any penalties for eliminating them like the game says it would in the tutorial for them.

All in all, a mostly negative review, but I can see the diamond in the rough here. With a lot more effort and polish, this game could be really special, and I encourage those interested to check it out, as it's relatively cheap, and short, and to offer advice to help improve this persons game. Just don't go expecting anything astounding when you play it as it is now.

Different weapons affect movement speed and how fast you can kill enemies; the strongest gun may come at the cost of slower strafing to avoid the aforementioned eye beams.

2131,1485580,"[h1]A set of chess puzzle-mazes[/h1]

It's a very simple game: in [i]Chess Valley[/i], you maneuver a directionally challenged king (he only moves in cardinal directions, not diagonally) through a maze of opponent chess pieces.

The enemies will stay still unless you move into a forbidden cell (as dictated by regular chess rules), which triggers a game over.

[h1]Little content[/h1]

Game always starts in the same level but the levels afterwards are randomly chosen from a list. After a while, they start to show repetition.

The game is ""completed"" (along with all Steam achievements) by finishing 50 puzzles in a row without mistakes. After initial hiccups and tired mistakes, I finished the game in about 17 minutes.

As there are just a few puzzles, there's limited replay value, unless you want to try for a speed run: there's an in-game timer that runs through all levels until finish. As there's no Steam Leaderboards, this is just for screenshot bragging for now.

Super-cheap game, it's an interesting idea and could well see expansion. Personally, I'd have enjoyed it more if there were a level selection screen and more puzzles. Albeit, with the small number of levels, the random variant works alright, but I can't help but think it's like that because of the small amount of content.

[h1]Limited options[/h1]

Game saves your score and lets you reset it. That's all the options though.

It natively runs in full-screen. Alt+Enter allows turning it into windowed mode and you can then resize it as you see fit. (Usually, Unity games as this have a launcher to adjust these outside the game but it's missing here - not that it's really needed.)

There's a dreamy ambient tune as a background music. Sounds and music cannot be adjusted from within game.

[h1]Cautious recommendation[/h1]

I bought it on a sale of -41% at €0,47 and got about 20 minutes out of it. That's less than I'd hope but acceptable in my books.

The concept is marvellous: chess rules bend themselves into all sorts of neat ideas, and this is another proof of that. I just wish there was more content, i.e. more puzzles and variation.

2134,1485580,"Chess Valley is a simple minimalist puzzle game with an easy to grasp mechanic. You simply need to get your King to the safety of his army on the other side of the board while avoiding the pitfall take over moves of your teams opposing pieces which are currently on the board. For those not familiar with chess, do not need to worry, as each level has tiles you can stand on to see how each chess piece moves before you even attempt a cross over. There are 50 puzzles in all and your given 3 lives in the hope of completing the game and earning all achievements. 

It can be really difficult to remember all the perilous steps on the board and sometimes you’re so often navigating around an enemy in front of you that you completely forget the enemy afar. This is where it can get severely tedious and aggravating as once you have squandered your 3 lives your then forced to go through all fifty levels again as there are no chapter save points. Another downer is the games algorithm that randomises the 50 levels for you. Instead of doing it so it randomly gives you the whole 50 levels ensuring you get to play all 50, instead you might get level 3 over maybe 4 times in your 50-run play through, so it seems plausible to me that you might actually miss a few of the 50 puzzles on offer here.

One of the BIGGEST gripes for me is the sound mechanic of your moving king. It is really loud and the repetitious clicking got on my nerves within minutes and there is no way to turn the sound down to it. An oversight which may not have happened if Brazilian developer Artur Rezende https://www.youtube.com/user/arturprojetista spent more time on developing his games instead of rushing and constantly publishing bare boned concepts. 

Already within 6 months he has pushed out Chess Valley 2 which from the trailer seems to add not much new other than a longer board and the ability to red or green mark squares as safe or not. The one soundtrack is exactly the same and the mechanics is essentially exactly the same. So why not perfect Chess Valley 1 first? Instead of making very tiny variations and marketing it as a completely different product? Why push out games with paper thin concept within months of each other or even within the same month? Do you want the reputation of being simply a shovel ware developer? Do you not believe in yourself to be anything more? Or do you simply not care? In truth this is hard to answer unless Artur stops and really raises the bar, pushes the envelope for himself and commits to creating something that he and others can be really proud of. 

Chess Valley is unique enough to be an aspiring franchise, but it would have served him better if he had divided the game in 10 level chapter segments and introduced a different mechanic with each chapter. A variety of soundtracks and backgrounds could have livened up the adventure of the puzzle solving here too, but as it stands, once you have solved the first 5 puzzles then in all honesty you’ve solved them all. 

Unless Artur really challenges himself, commits to producing an outstanding chess variant in the similar veins of tri dimensional chess, chess four, chess plus or even laser chess Khet. I’m afraid he may have already checkmated his development career with shovelling… (Barely gets a thumbs up from me) …

1) To complete all levels, you must do so in one sitting. With three lives, this will be a bit of a test of patience.
2) There is often, very obviously, only one move you can safely make, so many levels are on near autopilot.
3) You DO need to use the ""change camera"" command. As playing pieces are often hidden from view otherwise.

I think that this is a way you could have a kid burn a good half hour or so.  BUT,  this is just a little too unfinished.  There are not any instructions on how to set up the local co-op, splitscreen.  I am always on the lookout for local co-op games to play when people come over, and thought perhaps the collecting and more-over the soccer match might be fun for like 20 min or so.  This is not quite the case.  The controls are a little stiff.  It is unclear that to start the match you have to get a specific ball to play with the NPC (no, none of the other 6 balls around the court will do).  There are 3 slightly grey balls (which aren't useable to unlock anything or play with the NPC), then you'll unlock 3 white-grey balls that look almost the same color and bounce slightly (you can use these for the wall-ball challenge) and then .  You won't know anything about what to unlock unless you check the steam achievements.  There are not enough prompts to say, tell you that jumping repeatedly will make the balloon go higher into the sky.  Sure, you may do that by accident, but it is weird to have very clear prompts to tell you E is pick up and F is to dropkick something you are holding, but then ignore other prompts like jumping with spacebar and like a sort of dash with F when you aren't holding anything.  Did I figure these things out? Sure.  But why not have some in-game descriptions on what you have to do?  Also, you cannot quit the game.  You have to either X out of it if it is in windowed mode.  If it is fullscreen you will have to use task manager to end the program.  There is a weird thing where when you click ESC to pause the game (something you just guess, are never told) and it tells you to push Q to leave, but when you do it disconnects you as the player, but doesn't exit the game.  I've seen on other games of theirs that this can be a problem.  I'll likely play more of their games, I just think they need to put a little more polish in.  Maybe consider going back to older games at some point to make to work on controls and UI or something.

I can't recommend it since the game studio is essentially shelved support for this game. There are rows upon rows of bugs and glitches. NONE of which are helpful. They are all negative in some way. For once, I'd love a bug like, ""Woops, we made Shroom too strong"" just for a break from ""Woops, we deleted your save game...again"" or ""All your quests for characters are broken and you can't advance them""

The worst part about their bug checking system is that, if you go to their forums, they have a voting system on their bug reports. Since this game is struggling for players, no one goes to vote on any of the multitude of bugs/errors. Thus, they never get voted enough to get fixed.

My personal bug is that sections of the game such as the ""Station Cards"" won't unlock no matter how many times I complete the requirements. At this point, I realize that whatever code they use to check if you completed a task or not isn't correct. So the solution would be to delete my save and all the progress I've ever had to get them so that sounds terrible but it's my only option and I'm refusing to do that right now.

At this point, Amplitude Studios would need just a full bug patch. Just a patch where they don't work on ANY content whatsoever just so the game is patched through and through.

2167,1485590,"Greetings, today I’ll be reviewing Endless Dungeon, a rogue-lite stick shooter that I’ve had on my wish list for some time and despite the mixed reviews found the gameplay loop interesting.  Was I wrong or was the angry mob with pitchforks?  Let’s dicuss!

Tower Offense:  When everything boils down this is a stick shooter mechanically that has roguelite mechanics and feels like a tower defense.  Let me explain.  You play as character roaming through rooms that you unlock slowly to acquire more resources to get through the level.  You will encounter enemies that you destroy with various weapons in the vein of a top down stick shooter.  Occasionally those enemies will spawn a wave, which will attack you but ultimately go after your core or resource producers, to counter you have to build turrets and place yourself and other player (or bots) to cover multiple avenues of attack.  And finally, when this is all done (either through completion or death) you go back to a hub with some resources you can spend but the majority of what you did being lost.

Upgrade your Reading:  This is all done with serviceable graphics and audio, the controls are passable, I found myself getting stuck occasionally on corners and the AI behaved as about as best you can expect, so decent bones here.  The gameplay loop is basic but approachable and the concept of the story is one I’ve enjoyed in unplugged gaming.  …Wait?  You thought there was more?  Nope, best I can tell this is it…go to the next bullet point.

Will this Ever End:  But, is it fun?  Eh, with friends I’m sure but the gameplay loops feels…empty.  I’m not seeing much here, the individual concepts are all fun or at least in thought.  The idea of combining them is great, at least in concept.  As someone who has gotten into the design space of unplugged gaming recently I’ve found that some concepts sound great but in practice they fall apart.  I think this maybe the case.  It’s also possible that this is just missing more content, there doesn’t seem to be a there, there.  I find myself asking this game ‘what is it that you’d say you do’.  But trying to pin down my issue feels a lot like this game; opening another door, that looks like the previous.

So I’m entirely unsure, this game should be something special and maybe in co-op it is but being that I can’t just magically get all my friends a copy and can’t really endorse this game to them.  All games are more fun with friends, a truism that we’ve all come to accept but there just doesn’t seem to be enough here to actually get friends to play without it being a risk.  So for now, pass.

Its a cute simple little game and if you had a long day of work and are not bothered about a game being completely mindless then this is ok... but with no skill cap involved personally I would advise Islanders... better game that involves some level of thought.",0,1634527042,182,0,15

2179,1485650,"Zen World is a fun chill puzzle game in the vein of Dorfromantik and Mini Metro / Motorways.
At its core its a game where you expand the map with tiles, get boxes with upgrades and resources to expand more, and in the end you get a highscore.

It feels like a very basic version of Civilization that's drizzled down to its most essential elements (that being said I haven't played a lot of Civilization. This is NOT a 4X game, this is a puzzle game).

The developer has stated that in time there will be full controller support, more tile types, a mid-game save/load system, multiplayer (coop and versus), custom game mode with modifiers, better visual & effects and a lot more.

2180,1485650,"There are a lot of problems I have personally found with this game that hold it back from being anything other than annoying to sit through. To start with, if you're playing in the zen mode with infinite tiles you will find that you do not get nearly enough camps to deal with how frequently barbarians spawn in. There's no way to prioritize which towns get built which makes it unnecessarily hard to achieve the goals on levels where you have to build towns in certain spots because you just don't have enough tools. In all, the resources you get are far too limited and if you could actually have infinite camps and other tools within the zen mode that would improve that game mode a lot, also, maybe add an undo button.",0,1671318672,597,0,3

2183,1485650,"Might only be in alpha, but it's still very playable. It's a quick little game, fun to pick up and then drop again for a quick 30min round. Engaging without addicting, and relaxing without being mindless. Only the RNG and some slightly confusing mechanics (how to bridges work exactly?) can make it frustrating.

It reminds me a lot of Islanders in being a minimalist builder game, but with an extra layer of strategy. The basic premise is very similar to Dorfomatic, but this game is actually fun. It's also similar to mini-metro and mini-motorways in being a puzzle game where you have to cope with what the environment throws at you.


As it's an alpha, I'll also throw out some recommendations:
1) Make bridges slightly longer distance, at the moment they're rather useless IMO.
2) Add a toggable grid to show where the edges of the hexes are. It's very hard to see if a patch of grass is the centre of a hex where I can actually build something or if its a useless edge (same thing when looking for an appropriate spot for a coastal town on a new landmass)
3) The ability to flood a region (opposite of land reclamation) would be fun and in theme. Or a canal that acts as the opposite of a bridge.
4) Rewards for reaching score thresholds should be bigger. At the moment they're less worthwhile than most boxes on the map. It's a shame, because it rewards spidery expansion over making a complete and pretty world.
5) The roads on the map and the ships moving around look really cool. I think it would be nice to make them more functional too. If you could build a market on a tile with roads, and get points for every town connected to that road network. Something similar on the sea could give points for every town in range of it.
6) There's a serious shortage of tools available compared to flags for new towns. Either make tools easier to find, or give the player the ability to ""pause"" flags so that tools can be conserved for when they're really needed.
7) Universal tiles are rather weak, because they're so random. Giving the player the choice for whether the centre of the tile should be grass, forest or sea would make them useful. At the moment they're just a very weak version of the reveal neighbours marker.
8) I'd be tempted to say that scouts should have reduced range on land an increased range on sea. Make more sense from a ""realism"" point of view, and would also be more balanced.

2188,1485650,"Great relaxing zero-pressure puzzle game. If you like Dorfromantic while the gameplay is obviously different this game has the same ""zen"" vibe, beautiful landscape, and focus level (or non-focus level) as Dorfromantic. These games were meant for the same audience. 

You can play this game in a mindless zero-thought void and just restart it every time you run out of tiles, or you can play it to maximize a score and land on the leaderboard and dissect or plan every move. So it's great for those who just want to relax and equally good for those who want something a little complex to focus on. 

The devs have continued to expand on it, there are zero bugs or issues I have found, and it really is very zen. I think this is a game I can come back to for man many years and continue to enjoy each time I pick it up. It's not super complex or hard to learn, there isn't really a true end goal other than getting a higher score, there is no clock so the pace is whatever you want it to be. 

It may be boring to some but if you just want something light and maybe a little brain-busting (but only when you feel like it) this game is perfect. If you are someone used to shooters or fast-paced games, who doesn't enjoy slow methodical puzzles or something zen to play while watching TV late at night... then maybe not the game for you.

2189,1485650,"Game have potential, but right now, not so much. The menu screen lag on a 1080 with a Ryzen 7 3700x
Concept seem nice, but the unpolished UI and lack of QoL make it look like someone first unity3D project you do following youtube tutorial.

The game is advertised as a ""zen"" experience, but the Zen part is sold as a DLC for a game still in early access. Unless you follow an obscure clue about giving up your information or something to get a key reward if that even it (whatever the get it for free thingy mean on the dlc page)

The tiling is heavily influenced on a RNG broken pathfinding, which ended up making me loose on the second part of the tutorial because the AI could not get to the objective crossing a forest path, even though they could anywhere else on the set, except right where they were supposed to go. And yes, there was no water or barrier.

Missing QoL:

- Cannot save progress during campaign
- no option during a game
- no option to turn off depth of field
- cannot move the world by dragging the middle mouse button, have to use the keyboard
- no option to automatically select the next tile and open the ""loot box"" which I absolutely hate. I rather have my tiles right away rather than being forced to click those boxes, same with the bonus box on the bottom right corner count
- no option to restart the level without quitting back to the menu (or at least not one i seen)
- the pathfinding seem to be broken, i lost the second scenario from the little guy not going toward where you supposed to build the settlement, yet on the second attempt, they reached it, even though i clearly managed to redo the same path.
- if you accidentally put a water tile on the grand box like i did, the game is not automatically over, it continue until you run out of tiles, yet you cannot finish the scenario without collecting the box, wasting your time
- the low on tile popup and such get in your way when you have already a tile selected trying to place it
- completing the main objectives lead you to the end screen, with no option to continue so you can do the side objectives

It's a VERY COMPLEX game, took me 20+ hours of game play to clear the ""training"" levels, (Campaign 1 with 4 levels) and now at 100+ hours in I'm still stuck on Campaign # 2 at level 4 out of 10+ levels.

It's very tedious and if you just quick/Zen play you will fail 100% of the time, you must look at each options for each tile to try to maximise their use for the most productive way to extend toward area's you need to reach while LUCK dictate if you will be able to do so or not.

QUICK Conclusion : 

If you like a relaxing quick light Zen tiles placement game as advertised, this is NOT the game for you, each tiles placement must be done extremely strategically.   

It's more similar to games like FTL, Weird Worlds and Out There (that require a 100% strategics play, without any mistake), while luck can still break your ""perfectly played"" game.

Also daily challenges with 2 attempt, reward memory and time invested over skills, requiring you to sink hours daily, I'll play Sid Meier's Civilization V and VI and Total War instead with that much time instead of this ""quick"" little game.",0,1634126271,8393,29,48

Game Of Mafia indie adventure game about the mafia of the 1920s.

We play as a guy named Frank who wants to make his dream of opening his own bar a reality.

Our task will be to manage it, protect it from the attack of bandits and prove that you are a real gangster.

The game has many different references to various events for which thanks the developers.

Good story, pixel art, great soundtrack.

2353,1484720,"[h1]I fell in love with rougelikes again[/h1]
Synonymous with getting the player repeatedly killed, rougelikes are a vicious bunch. Often striding to deliver the ultimate challenge or aiming to extend longevity of the gameplay loop through varied repetition, these are the games for the thrill-seekers. Or at least they should be, as nowadays the genre has become mudded down to the point where “rougelike” tag plastered over Grizzly Lawnmower Simulatortm no longer raises an eyebrow. Victim of its own success, especially among indie games, the life-extending quality of repetition spiced-up through random elements lead to an abundance of titles which had rougelike aspects glued on as a last-ditch attempt to diversify otherwise overly simplistic gameplay. In an era of “open-world MMO FPS survival with rougelike dangly bits”, Dead Estate proudly sets out to focus on a single thing but do it really well. A commendable approach, which results in the best qualities of the genre being brought forth into the limelight.

[b]Flee the mansion![/b]
One explosive intro animation later, a character of your choice enters the titular estate with nothing but a gun in hand and the will to survive. In the very first room I was immediately struck by the game’s distinct visual style – every single area of the game is a square tilted at exact 45˚ angle, taking up roughly 2/3 of the screen, with remaining space dedicated to HUD elements. Despite oddly symmetrical interior design, the player’s character is able to both move and shoot within full 360˚ spectrum which creates a peculiar perspective that frankly takes a while to get used to.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3293227991[/url]
No better way to approach this hurdle, than to explore your surroundings. Dead Estate’s gameplay loop gets devilishly simple from there – kill monsters, loot treasure, upgrade your character at local shop, find a key, open the boss arena and ascend to the next level. Simple on paper that is, as getting to know Dead Estate is done through genre’s staple brand of trial and error – with a fair few “game over” screens worked in-between. This is also where this title’s most profound quality comes into play – it never gets tedious.

[b]Grab your gun[/b]
Every level of the estate is randomly generated as the player enters, however the pool of blocks which may be used in its construction is relatively limited. Thus, a degree of familiarity with one’s surroundings comes fairly natural in Dead Estate, not that the knowledge of what’s likely to lay ahead makes it that much easier to deal with. Instead of the mansion itself, the game turns to multitude of characters and items the player may pick up along the way to spice up the gameplay loop. Would you pick Jeff? A bulky truck driver with a humble pistol but ability to take a punch. Or perhaps Jules, a nimble high-school dropout trading life for agility and shotgun is more up your alley? There is a character centred around every core mechanic of the game – melee, ranged, magic... or money. Each one of them gradually unlocked by the player.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3293229120[/url]
No matter where your chosen character’s strengths lay, their affinities may be turned on their heads depending on items you collect throughout the estate. With item count going well over 200, they include perks varying from humble stat boost, through randomly dropping an anvil into the room, up to turning your fists into damage-increasing cookies. Given there is no upper limit to the number of items a character may hold at a time (although “only” first 72 will be displayed, to put that into perspective) your mundane shotgun-wielding run may very well end with automated rocket launcher covering the room with radiation.

Deserving a separate mention are the weapons themselves. Every character has a dedicated primary one, often shaping their core mechanic. Still, there is over 60 secondary options to choose from. While some of the tools of the trade are ordinary (though no less effective) such as machine guns, swords or grenade launchers, Dead Estate’s laid-back approach reflects does not shy away from exotic pieces – such as squeaking toy bear, vacuum cleaner, trumpet or a sex gun (shooting six bullets a time, silly). Using some of them can be challenging or even straight-up dangerous but they certainly liven up the gameplay.

[b]Perfectly balanced[/b]
This may be a skewered perspective of the genre’s veteran, however for me Dead Estate achieves a perfect balance between being extremely approachable and retaining a sufficient level of challenge to make the progress feel satisfying. Anticipating a lengthy learning period, I was quite astonished when instead I’ve beaten the game during my fifth run. Naturally, as it comes to the games such as these, I’ve barely scratched the surface of what this title has to offer. Nonetheless, this small victory put a smile on my face and made me hungry for more. Luckily, there is a lot to unlock in Dead Estate and the game continuously drops breadcrumbs, pointing the player towards accessing further content – alternative levels, diverse new characters, “true” ending and more. No matter whether you are a novice or a master, whether you chose to play 10 or 100 hours, Dead Estate manages to deliver uniquely consistent sense of satisfaction throughout.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3293229529[/url]
[b] Playing for the plot [/b]
It would be a travesty not to mention final ingredient contributing to the game’s fun factor – its light-hearted sense of humour. Yes, you may be running away from a monster-ridden mansion of murder but it doesn’t mean you need to take it too seriously. Dead Estate’s tone is set perfectly by its cinematic trailer, a highly recommended watch if you haven’t already. Be it absurd weapons, item descriptions, meme references, or stellar introduction cutscenes for each character – they all introduce a cosy mirth to the tone of the game, making it a charming proposition at the end of a long day.

Before anyone starts pointing out at a certain theme related to physique of the characters present in the game, Milkbar Lads chose to embrace the fan service, proudly displaying its selling points for all to see. Approach the matter at your own discretion, it does however declare a mature target audience.

[b]Love at the second sight[/b]
I have to admit, the title of this review leaves little room for doubt as to what the final verdict will be, and for a good reason too. In my book Dead Estate’s overwhelmingly positive rating on Steam not only is well-earned, better yet, this game has effectively reignited my passion for the genre. I was first drawn in by The Binding of Isaac, now Dead Estate managed to relit the rougelike spark a decade later in a life of a now much busier gamer. I’ve consistently kept returning for a quick round or two for ever since. If indie games hold any water to you, this is the gem you might be looking for.",1,1721489647,4054,70,105

2356,1484720,"Overall, this is a really good rogue lite. It has unlockable characters that add variety to the gameplay. An enjoyable story that you slowly discover over different playthroughs. A vast array of items and weapons that will make each run feel a little bit different. The devs are clearly very passionate and have put a great deal into making, improving, and adding to their game.

I also hear the new mode with anya is also good for a survival horror esque mode. There are lots of achievements and endings to hunt for. It even has a pause button so you can take a break during a run, which is just a wonderful QoL feature.

If you like challenging but in a nice way games that have a lot of replayability (like risk of rain 2) then this is the game for you. 

But, there are some drawbacks. For one thing is game stability. There's one character you unlock who uses bombs. But, when they explode near too many objects, the game gets a bit stuttery. It worsens the more items you have that add weapon modifiers. It also gets worse when there are more enemies on screen. I managed to soft lock a run because I had so many ability modifiers. Granted, I had an absurd amount of things, but I wanted to share that crashes are possible with too many effects and objects acting at the same time. I have also found that the more isometric look of the game can be a bit disorienting, buuut I am pretty sure that's just a me thing.

My biggest issue with the game, and what made me inevitably uninstall it with a sigh of sadness, is Chunks. He's the big mouse guy and is a recuring enemy as well as the final boss of normal runs. He is also the guy who keeps pressure on the player to move from floor to floor. If you take too long on one floor, he shows up and chases you until you knock him out (often at the cost of most of your HP) or until you enter a safe room or boss room. I like the idea in concept, an enemy to keep some anxiety on the player's mind to facilitate constant upward momentum to the final floor. However, after a bunch of runs, he just became annoying to me. Every floor there'es more rooms to explore, and sometimes he showed up before I even found a key to the boss door. Making clearing rooms all the more difficult, and later just tiresome. If there was a toggle added to the game that turned chunks off except for his fight, I'd instantly re-download the game. However, I find him to be more and more of a deciding factor of me not even reopening the game, let alone starting a run. And, as of writing this review, my last run with him did me in. Yes, I took him down at the cost of 1 HP, but it still took me out of the previous happy flow I was in.

I think most everyone else will have a great time with this game. But, being corrupted by the masterpiece that is RoR2, I just prefer a game that lets me take my time in levels without being pestered by the final boss when I ""take too long"". 

I think this game is great, and the devs are even more amazing, go try it already!",1,1722746641,752,16,9

The graphics are impressive, there is an amazing balance between Gameplay and Visuals, I've only seen one type of enemy so far, and am curious if newer types of challenging opponents will be implemented, as well as probable expansion of the pre-existing arsenal. 

The game runs smoothly for me at least, the hitbox areas for Enemies are a bit offset I have to aim below the target with the squarehair or I don't understand 100% how the shooting behaves, and I can't tell how much health I have other than the visual effects around the edges of the screen. *Edit I redact this There is a way I was just retarded.*

on top of that, the loop lags and has low framerate at the end of every loop, so it's either a memory leak or just they spawn so much bs that they can't cull and the performance stays bad until you reset the loop.

it's entirely too meta and the game constantly says it sucks, and like, if you say it enough, yeah you're right. the game says it sucks, like a lot, like almost constantly. the music lyrics are also just meta, like it's too much. if it was just the music or like 1 reference from a mad character saying they think it sucks, sure whatever, but like have some fuckin dignity and self-respect.",0,1718005504,118,0,449

Kinda janky and the game is short, finished it in 2.6 hours. 
Probably 30 minutes of that was spent replaying long levels after dying near the end.

Some questionable design decisions: 
-Boss levels were frustrating and detracts from the pace of the game.
-Sewer level fans have a huge hitbox that instakills you-final fan of the level killed me twice when rolling through it, forcing me to replay it.
-Sliding doors have a solid part over it, so you can't tell if it's open or closed properly, and the AI in this game can do 180 trickshots to instantly shoot you.

Decent soundtrack.
Overall I'd rate this game as neutral, but slightly tipping over to the ""no"" side.",0,1658239159,156,0,18
2395,1485070,"Quick Description:
-Esse Proxy is a fast paced, brutal, cyperpunk, top down shooter that looks to pick up where Hotline Miami left off.  I have been looking forward to playing this one since I first saw a trailer about 2 years ago.  I had really high hopes for this one, but I ended up being quite disappointed w/ the final result.  It has some cool ideas but comes up very short of competing w/ it's predecessors.  

What's Good:
-This game has a really cool visual style.  When I watched the trailers, I immediately thought that this game looked like a cyberpunk version of Hotline Miami w/ better visuals.  This game looks top notch visually.  I do wish there was more diversity in the environments, but that's a very small gripe.
-This is a really challenging, yet rewarding game.  Like Hotline Miami, you will die in one hit.  You will need to be quick on your toes, memorize enemies locations, and make smart, tactical decisions.  The early levels are my favorite, and I think they strike the perfect balance.  I can't say the same for the later levels, but I'll discuss that in more depth.
-This game has a top notch soundtrack that fits the world that you are part of perfectly.  The sound design as a whole is really well designed and I have no complaints here.

Could Use Some Changes:
-Unfortunately, I ran into quite a few bugs and had some framerate issues.  I ran into a small bug at least every other level and 3-4 times got stuck in the environment and had to start over.  This is a massive problem b/c these levels are really challenging, and it can be heartbreaking to have to start all over b/c of technical issue.  The game frequently ran at 30 fps which is really not acceptable for modern games.
-I did not enjoy the boss levels at all.  The chase level was extremely frustrating.  Not only do you have to keep up w/ the guy you are chasing or you'll have to start over, but you can easily die from a stray bullet that wasn't even aimed at you.  As irritating as this level was, the boss w/ the mech suit was by far the worst in the game imo.  It's just not fun.  You have to wait for him to blow up barricades, and then wait for the bridge to open, but he can speed across the room in split seconds.  Once you get past this, if you die on the next area, you have to start all over.  This is infuriating.  I didn't even know that my mech suit could shoot missiles until my 3rd attempt.  Nothing about this boss battle matches any other part of the game, and feels out of place.
-I think the pacing could use some work.  Imo, the game is at it's best early, but starts to go off the rails the final 1/3 of the game.  It just doesn't feel as balanced or fun.  It's also very short for the $20 asking price.  Most ppl will beat the game in 3-5 hrs and there isn't a ton of reasons to replay the game.

Consensus:
-Bottom Shelf Game (Tier 5 and makes up 10% of my reviews).  Hotline Miami 1 and 2 are two of my very favorite games, so I had really high hopes for Esse Proxy.  I do think that there is a solid game in here w/ a few patches and updates.  If the frame rate/bugs could be ironed out, and then the boss battles tweaked a bit, and maybe a few more bonus levels upon completing the main game, then this would be one that I could be more excited about.  As of now, I can't recommend this game.  This was one of more anticipated games this year, but it just didn't live up to the hype.  I'd recommend playing Hotline Miami 1 and 2, Serial Cleaner, Party Hard 2, and Intravenous before this one.",0,1660181292,272,0,340

2400,1485070,"Amazing Game!

I'm a huge fan of strategy and turn-based games, and  to be fair, you might be wondering why I am mentioning this. Well, Esse Proxy accomplishes a feeling that great turn based games do, that feeling that goes along the lines of “I NEED TO PLAY ONE MORE TURN! I NEED IT!” which is incredible since it doesn't have turns, It doesn't even have a pause button, so how does it manage it? It´s a mix, I think. The art of the game is stylish, the action is super fluid and dynamic, the music is astonishing and over the top, the consequences of each shot being fired are both thrilling and rewarding, every time you land one and see a splattering head or a piece of body dismembering. There is a weird sense of joy in every reload, I don't mind dying at all, I just want to go again; I don't even consider playing slower more carefully. No, that´s for losers. I just go in feeling like a badass, guns blazing, trying to look super cool. If I die, so be it, the next try I might get it.

The gameplay is good. Simple, effective and with variants in between to keep the game interesting. The scenarios are well designed and offer different variants and approaches to being solved. The bosses are nice, the areas look cool and the encounters are fun and a good change of pace. 

Characters have different skills. All of them feel powerful and decisive when used. All of them felt compelling to me and I wished they were even more developed during the story. Maybe in a future game or future content. Especially Faceless. But the entire roster was cool. 

The story seems interesting, although you get it in small pieces here and there. Also I had to play a few times to get the grip about what was going on, and even then I still don't fully understand it entirely (mind you I haven´t reach the secret ending yet)

All in All, I think it's a great game considering it´s price range. I still have some more hours of fun left in it.

- Think of this as a less intricate, non-RPG version of The Ascent

- The game's aesthetics and audio are well designed and polished; definitely not going to be an eyesore for sure

- There isn't much of a story; or if there is one, I might have been too confused to know what's really going on

- Gameplay is nothing ground breaking; but its slick and clean gunplay, and lack of any loading screens, means the fun lies in memorizing enemy positions and actions, and taking them out in the slickest, quickest, and most satisfying ways.

- Downside is that in the later levels, things get more difficult and stages are longer with no checkpoints; so you inadvertently end up playing it safe (which defeats the fun in the first place).

High-octane relatively fluid and challenging action with an adrenaline-packed quality soundtrack made replaying lvls pure joy for me. I also appreciated adding new elements to freshen up the gameplay, not something you would expect but nice additions to make it seem more of a cyberpunk adventure.
I am not sure I understood all sections of the story because I was too in the zone :D 
There is some jank, tho I haven't experienced any issues and overall for an indie, it felt very good.

2474,1485190,"It's cute.

* Best thing about it is that it looks super nice. The backgrounds blend well with the sprites and CGs, they seem to have the same style; the characters in sprites and CGs are detailed, they look like a lot of work was put into them.
Sadly, no ""sexy time"" CGs, but it does say so in the game description (that it happens off camera). However, you do get a kiss CG and a ""making out and will soon do it"" CG (per romance).

* 3 romance options for now - you have to pick kinda early, when two of the 3 options feel like ""eh, why would I ever pick this dude"".

* Not sure if the story wants to be serious or not, falls into parody at times and other times someone loses an arm. Mostly it's because you have something like a bot talking to you all the time in your head and they're the comic relief - even in romance scenes, making them a bit of a joke.
It also gets a bit too much into repeating over and over how it's OK to be gay - it's probably meant to be the moral / theme of the game, but it gets too preachy, like they're trying to help someone playing this game get out of the closet.

* Choices are... there but not really choices. Basically 3 types:
1. Choose your route / romance interest - that one choice after you meet all romances
2. Dead ends (aka game over) - where you're literally told ""you made the wrong choice, go pick the right one""
3. Others that change nothing.

Overall it's pretty light an fun.",1,1617899210,1477,0,105
2475,1485190,"I played this as a favor to someone from Y Press who responded to my comment on Itch.io that it didn't have appropriate tags. I now think that the warnings are sufficient, but that there should also be a tag for ""Alpha/Beta"". I still don't like the game from a moral perspective. 


In short:

The MC struggles the entire time to reconcile the fact that he is straight, when the planet he is on is causing him to feel attracted to these men. A robotic backpack that is in his head and the LIs are constantly berating him for feeling confused. The backpack is constantly invalidating Demetri's feelings and the whole thing comes off as manipulative quite often. They try to coerce the MC into saying he will have sex with them the first day they spend time with him. The story only spans a weeks time at most, and it feels like Demetri is constantly being harassed.


In long:

Well, turns out Jader has the most uncomfortable route. I do think there was a lot of dubious consent with kissing in this, but the actual sex scenes I guess weren't. I do see tags for ""mentions of rape and dubious consent"" tagged on the store page which is good.

The relationships still come across as awkward and manipulative. The story appears to only cover the span of a week or less, but the ENTIRE time the LIs are either whining or angry at you for not saying you will have sex with them. Your brainbox is also constantly chiming in to tell you you're being stupid for refusing them and negating your feelings. And you will always be the Beta.

(Demetri's story about his complicated relationship with his dad does nothing for the story. It also doesn't seem believable and makes Demetri look too self aware. Also, he only tells it to the Brainbox in every route, never the LIs, so what's the point? And people don't need a backstory or reason to be straight or gay or bi etc... They just are. If you are genderfluid or bi or poly or whatever, then that's fine. It doesn't mean that everyone should/could be though)

In every route you end up bartering with the LIs. You get something from them and they get your affection, and this is especially true in Zheng's route. The LIs are always giving the MC ultimatums for telling them he will be with them and have sex with them. And this is even used to twist it into being Demetri's fault that Jader threatens to rape him??? It doesn't come to that, but it is wrong. Basically, I think the story avoids non consensual sex, but almost all of the dialogue leading up to it is manipulative, uninformed, and convoluted.
Would you feel the same way about this story if Demetri was a gay guy and Secren was full of women or if Demetri was a gay woman coming to this Secren full of men?

The fact that in Zheng's route they talk about the ""effects of Lightning"" fading once they leave the planet reinforces my belief (and Demetri's belief), that the game tries to deny, that Lightning is controlling Demetri. If Lightning just ""shows you the inevitable feelings that you would develop"" for someone, then why do they refer to it's ""effect"" fading or it magnifying your feelings for someone once you ""bond""??? If it is just showing who would be very good potential matches, then why would leaving Secren be so terrible? Wouldn't you still have feelings for the person?


Uncomfortable dialogue in no particular order:

""I'm sick of fighting these feelings"" - with Zheng 

""I don't know what I'm feeling. I wish life on this planet wasn't so damned complicated"" to which Brainbox replies ""You brought the complications with you"" - Helix

""He makes me feel guilty for being Hetero"" - with Helix

""After all, men on Earth can change their orientation based on circumstances. Hetero men have gay sex in prison"" then Demetri replies that that's true but thee are also instances where ""orientation can be fluid"". Brainbox replies ""So, why is it so difficult for you to accept Helix? You're not some ignorant homophobe. Even if you were, such nonsense couldn't have withstood the power of lightning"" - with All?

""Stick it in, Demi, but don't get used to me saying that"" (Ok so Helix can have preferences but Demetri can't?)- with Helix

""Part of me wonders if that would have made things easier for me. If you just... I don't know...raped me."" - Helix

""It was hard to make the decision, but when I did, it felt right. I can't do much for him, but I can at least do this"" - In regards to offering to give Helix a blow job because he looked ""stressed and horny"" and had had a long day.

""Why would your feelings distress you?"" oh because he feels like he's ""being manipulated into being interested in another man"" - All

Demetri saying to Jader ""I can't be your lover...I'm straight"" and a side character saying ""Horse shit! Every earthling says that. Every earthling gets over it!"" - with Jader

*** The whole conversation with Jader on literally the first day: Basically your brainbox tells Jader to ""wait to make his move"" until Demetri is ""well and truly seduced"". This is after a convo about how Secren men rape each other to prove who is the Alpha. Demetri, for some reason, didn't make it clear that he doesn't want to do it that way but was thinking that he is not ok with that. Demetri yells at his brain box saying, ""You could have made it clear I'm not into attempted rape!"" and brain box replies ""Not even you are clear on that, Demetri, and this is a valid solution to your irrational hesitation"" The brain box goes on saying something like 'well, it won't be as nice as you having sex willingly, but it's the only way since you're so stubborn and such...- Jader

Demetri saying ""This is my body, I'm in charge"" and then brainbox asserting that it in fact is not Demetris body but that they both own it. - with Jader

Demetri saying ""I'm straight"" and Jader replying ""Isn't that just a word?"" - Jader

""There! I've put you to sleep."" Brainbox forcing Demetri to immediately go to sleep without his consent. - Jader

""He's threatening to rape me Brainbox!"" ""Only because you'd force him to force you! You're the one in the wrong here!""

""It's time to put up or shut up"" coming from your Brainbox saying that since you killed the guy trying to kill you, you now have no 'excuses' not to have sex with Jader - Jader

""It's like my feet want to go one way, and my heart wants to go another"" - Jader


Weird moments/mistakes?:

Jaders blushing is not aligned right on his face for the entire game. there is a large gap between his blush and his eye.
The romantic scene with Zheng switches between two CGs where you're both wearing different clothes and it switches like 4 times? Looks off.
How/why is Demetri giving Helix a blow job when Demetri has a broken leg that ""looks bad"" and ""really swollen""...?
Calling Demetri sexist for asking if men wouldn't make better soldiers since they can selectively breed for men. This is after being told they selectively breed men to be miners because ""Men are better miners. Women just for breeding""
Zipso says ""I smell fucking you""
Demetri is surprised Zipso is speaking to him in English??? There was never another language mentioned?
Don't recall where but in Helix's route he's pissed at you one moment and the next you two are just happy and fine like nothing happened and never bring it up again...
It ends with the same CG of Demetri looking dead/tired. There is a note saying you ran out of time for an ending CG, but why make it end like this then? End with a sunset or something you already have?

2476,1485190,"I really wanted to like this game. it has some really pretty artwork, but I am not comfortable recommending this game to others. The production value is fine, it is the treatment of the protagonist that disturbs me. (I am also a little bothered the fact I can only scroll back line by line to read history, but that is minor.) If what I say below doesn't bother or faze you, then this game might be a solid purchase for you. :) 

While I get that the pairings need some external motivational stimulus as the protagonist is very opposed to same-sex relationships, I am not comfortable with how the AI inside his brain and your chosen love interest just gaslights and emotionally manipulates you with ultimatums to ""convince"" you to enter the relationships. The AI is basically a fujoshi who does not respect your decisions. I would've been okay with the character development of dealing with internalized homophobia or coming to terms with bisexuality, or any other form of self-discovery of sexuality or the lack thereof, but the whole prodding and shoving someone into a relationship that they are clearly uncomfortable with made, and still makes [i]me[/i] really uncomfortable.

2477,1485190,"Alright listen...

Id just like to preface this review by saying that I LOVE Y PRESS Games. Its a great company, and I usually have nothing but the highest praise for the games they make. They have great artwork, amazing voice actors, and some of the best storytelling you can hope for in romance games with adult focus. I have nearly every game they've made, and I get excited as HELL when a new on is announced, I've evened helped fund a few on Kickstarter.  

Having said all that, this game has a MAJOR issue and it truly made it hard to enjoy all its positives.

And that issue was...how its main character's sexuality was completely disregarded in a very disrespectful way.

I get it, this is a yaoi game. I came here for yaoi romance, and was looking forward to it. I came here to watch a capable but justifiably defensive and wary protagonist find romance in a bleak and Mad Max-equse planet by learning to open up his heart (and cheeks) to the idea of true love and sexy times with alien men that want him.

What I did NOT come here for, was a young man in bad situation have it made 10x WORSE by everyone and their mother (including the fricken voice in his HEAD) telling him ""The sexual orientation you've identified as most of your life is stupid and silly and the only reason you THINK you have it because your an off-world hick who hasn't found the right penis yet.""

Im sorry...the fuck?

I felt my blood pressure rise each time (and there are FAR to many) that crap happened. I picked Jader's route first, and the fact that he was such a sweetheart who respected your initial protests and tried to woo Demetri slowly was the ONLY thing that kept me on board.

Its was bad story telling to rush the romance and it showed so much. Sure, ONE closed minded NPC feeling that way could be played off as a fluke of the character, but Brainbox chiming in every ten seconds like a worse version of Navi was PAINFUL to sit through over and over. 

A straight person coming to the realization that they are actually bi (or maybe even demi because although Demetri says he doesn't like men, he also doesn't talk about missing women all that much either) could have been told a lot of different ways and still turned out amazing. The idea of ""Lightning"" an actual FORCE on the planet that helps you find your soulmate was such a cool idea and i was looking forward to the game showing how that sort of bond could transcend differences of species and even sexuality.
Instead, we got a half-assed attempt at bashing heterosexuality.

2480,1485190,"There are several other reviews that cover a lot of the red flags with this one, so go read those too, but really I just want to say this story had potential and it sort of just flops. Some people like VNs for the story, for being able to shape the plot, and some people want more of a veiled excuse for romance and intimate dealings. This is neither (the story/choices are lack-luster and the romance/intimacy moments are disappointing and even a bit boring).
It's a shame, because if time was taken to sharpen the plot and characters, and, you know, remove the abuse that goes into manipulating the MC and shaming him for not being homosexual, there could be something good here.
Also, the brainbox thing is absolutely ridiculous and distracting. I found it to be one of the worst aspects of this experience. It is a totally unnecessary character that has been shoe-horned in to try to justify the abuse on the MC. It's like they think that because the AI is ""connected"" to the MC it's okay to just mercilessly berate him about his sexuality? It frequently reminds us that ""they're the same person,"" except the brainbox has its own agenda directly opposed to the MCs and its personality, not to mention, the way it speaks alone would drive anyone to rip it right out of their nervous system. It's downright annoying from a literary perspective, and, seriously, the MC just has a permanent metal backpack strapped to him all the time? This just becomes yet another thing the MC is pressured about; being permanently tethered to this stupid box because it will traumatize it if they're disconnected? Why?
There's still potential, but you'd need a good editor, some patience, and a good chunk of time to look critically at this and refine it. I was pretty disappointed in it and I honestly don't really even want this in my library anymore.

So, I was stuck with this game since you can't return after 2 hours of play (and lord knows you can't really get a true and fair feel for a VN in only 2 hours) I mulled it over and decided to give the other routes a shot. I will say, I wasn't moved to alter my previous comments; they still stand, but I think I understand maybe what the creators were going for. Obviously the desire was to create tension, some conflict with the MCs sexuality, but it's the way it was done and the lack of real resolution that made it, well, disgusting.  There was real potential here to do this a better way and make a so-so story really stand out (and also maybe even make it heart-warming and meaningful). There's a lot of plot holes and little bits here and there that make no sense in the context of the setting (example: referencing Easter Eggs in Zheng-Li's route??? WTH should any of the characters know Easter how present day Earth knows Easter?).
I also see that the brainbox thing was probably just trying to do something different with narration (really by trying to eliminate narration), but I'm sorry, it flops here.  Narration is a key tool in story-immersion to help readers paint the picture, and there's nothing wrong with using it, even if you use it minimally, and any book you pick up about writing or editing will tell you that. There are large chunks in the plot of these routes that are just glazed over that a little narration could have really helped (another example from Zheng's route--when he visits the mines to see the deplorable conditions). These could have been very character-defining moments but they were wasted. 
I'm this far in and I may as well see all there is to see, so I'm going to try Sawyer's route and see how I feel after (and if I want to add praise or more pissy commentary to this review).

...Sawyers route was actually pretty good. Possibly the best. Relationship dynamic was more organic, less forced and less disrespectful/derogatory. Plot was fun too, very neat idea I think. Even brainbox was less annoying.",0,1641222797,1024,0,3

2482,1485190,"So far I am actually enjoying this visual novel.

I did Zheng-Li's route first contrary to the game's belief since they made him act like the Draco Malfoy of hot aliens. He is the arrogant and wealthy ""ruler"" of the planet Sacren where the miners are overworked practically to death for a valuable fuel for other worlds. His route really took me by surprise and it really does show the duality of situations that made me reconsider the severity of Zheng-Li's dilemma. 

The game itself reminds me of Togainu no Chi Lost Blood, another BL visual novel, in which both have a strong male protagonist whose own sense of strength and masculinity is challenged as they are forced to enter a world where death is perhaps a mercy (and men schmuck each other).

But what distinguishes this game from Lost Blood is how it handles its story and characters. For instance, the game doesn't force gore down your throat. The game balances its rather depressing dialogue about the miners being treated as expendable slaves with its humorous version of Navi in the form of Brainbox, the AI who basically represents every BL shipper in existence. 

For now, I recommend this game if you want a BL visual novel that isn't too gory or full of anthropomorphic animals (nothing against those who enjoy it).",1,1618124677,471,0,232
2483,1485190,"Okay, so I'll be honest, I bought and downloaded this as a guilty pleasure because I'm a sucker for the cliche yaoi stuff. I wholly expected to cringe and laugh. And I did. But I loved every second of it. I'm kind of sad it's so short, tbh. The art was good, though be prepared for the kiss scenes to be over the top and filled with ~sparkles~ but it's expected with the genre. From an ironic stand point; this game is glorious and delivers.

HOWEVER; I also ADORE the world building, entirely unironically. The world as it's presenting has so much potential. While I usually prefer up front, grittier stuff like DMMD and this game glazes over things like drug withdrawals [spoiler](It's not as easy as Jader has it in his path, sorry)[/spoiler] and doesn't particularly get into anything gritty for the main character, it still doesn't pull punches. The miners' situation is shitty as fuck. And it tells you. There's a lot of thought put into the world beyond the one planet, too, and I appreciate that.

As for cons, I have no desire to return back to it to try and get all the endings. There's no particular replay value to me, I played all the routes and I'm done. I'm excited for the next route whenever it comes out, but that's it, really. I like the world, but not enough to go back through it. I don't feel like I missed anything missing any of the bad endings, most of them are easy to avoid, too. The choices don't feel particularly challenging to me, mostly common sense from the protagonist's point of view.",1,1618723023,355,0,1
2484,1485190,"I have 2 concernes with this game:

- First I've played Gods of Love... You know, the first game done by this same team... Even some completly free lazy indie game teams won't re-use illustrations AND musics of there other games so obviously! I fell so disrespected ! I was so pissed and disappointed :/
You even did a crowdfunding and we still have the same backgrounds for the realm of Lysander AND for the fortress of Zheng-li !

- And second, most of the musics are completly out of thune... (probably because they weren't meant for this game at first) I recommand to shut them for a better experience. And to choose an appropriate playlist on youtube.

BUT the story his great and the original illustrations are awesome. So play it... (but with an angry face).

I've read the web novels on kindle a long time ago and it's good to see a game about it. Yaoi + space cowboys is just a must for me -^^-
So when i saw your game on it, that was an insta-buy ! Plus I loved all the games edited by YPG so far.
The storys are thrilling ! If you're into Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, Borderland or Warhammer 40k like me, you'll be delighted \o/
It was nice to meet again Helix et Demetri, and even the anoying BrainBox. Zheng-li and Jader where nice surprises too. In fact I choose Jader first because he was so intriguing ! And I don't regreat it o/

The setting that feels like the wild west and the social issues within the world. It's easy to understand and interesting, like I would still enjoy even without the romance.

But the romance is definitely appreciated... hehehe

Every romance possible is enjoyable in its own way. The path you take feels like it also makes an impact on the world around you, like the way you help to change the current conditions and how certain paths do not change anything about the world itself at all. I feel like the route with Helix is the most 'complete' in terms of handling every problem that could arise.

2489,1485190,"I confess I'm not generally a fan of the ""fated mates"" trope, in which some mystical power or biological function determines that THIS ONE is for you, whether you like it or not. I'm also VERY much not a fan of forcing people to go against their sexual identity. I cringed every time our heterosexual hero was told that he'd have to give in to gay sex, because ""Lightning"" had determined he'd fall in love with a man. Seriously? How many gay men have been told they'd eventually be okay with a heterosexual marriage society forced them into? At least in this one, our hero has 3 different ""fated mates"" to choose from.

That aside, I did enjoy this game. For one, it's MUCH better written than most of the gay Visual Novels I've played through (with a few notable exceptions). There were times when I was clicking through massive dialog loops as characters argued about something they had ALREADY AGREED ON, but overall it was well done and very engrossing. The story was fairly long and convoluted, and a twist would keep it going when I thought I'd reached the end (which was good). It took almost 5 hours of game play to reach the ending, and I still have two very different paths I can go back and explore. 

The artwork was likewise considerably better than most of the VN games popping up on Steam lately. I was surprised to find all the sex scenes fading to black with no explicit sex on screen at all, but that's actually mentioned in the game description. I was just too lazy to read it. :-p It's fine. I don't need explicit sex. I need a good story and well-written dialog, and that's what I got.",1,1714596984,293,0,115

Early on Brainbox declares that it will never act in opposition to Demetri's wishes yet it acts frequently in opposition all the time with numerous comments made not only to Demetri but also directly to other characters, manipulating and influencing the situations to get Brainbox's desired outcome.  What art existed was gorgeous but there isn't enough of it -- what art you see is heavily repeated throughout the game.  On one or more occasions you'll see a character's one permanent ""bionic eye"" switch absurdly from right to left to right, just because they wanted that character to be angled a different direction and wanted to reuse the same art.  For some reason my screen went black whenever the game got to a steamy scene -- if that's by design then the game was really a waste.  The game was generally a big disappointment.",0,1696114119,188,0,16
2491,1485190,"In progress review; I'm playing this on a steamdeck.
I think I recommend this but I have one minor issue; the love interests talk a lot about Alpha/Beta categories which seem to have 0 meaning; no social implications or hierarchy, no implication on top/bottom, no pregnancy (thank god). Just seems like another way to make the MC have a reason to be the straight lens in a BL game.
He isn't homophobic thankfully but I had to remind myself at times that he was repressed bye homophobic upbringing and not sex repulsed. As an asexual, I would identify with him a lot as someone uncomfortable with sexual situations and being emotionally manipulated to put out. The fact characters kept saying he was selfish for having a slower pace and discomfort was creepy and upsetting. I get what they meant in universe, but... I dunno, probably could have written that with more empathetic lens for those with trauma or non-trauma related discomfort, if you're going to go and make a sexually awkward MC. 

The MC you're supposed to go for first, and like the most, I found was kinda rude and dismissive of anyone outside his group, which seemed inconsistent with his good guy vibe. Didn't really like him.
The character I went for first, and liked the most, the ending indicated he would be everyones last route (rude). He's worse in other playthroughs but he's really cute in his own route... Also has gorgeous hair.

Not keen on possessive behaviour, jealousy, or pushing roles on people in relationships. Sadly they feature pretty strongly in this game. However, there is no sexual assault, no one pushes anything physically onto you, they are horrified at the idea of ignoring consent (even if they're emotionally coersive, if you ask me). 
You can opt to not see the one graphic part of the game without losing content, you get a warning each time so you can pick to see or not see. Which is a lovely way to approach this part of the game, and I thank the devs so much for that (despite not having a problem with gore, it's such a good move)!

Accessibility:
+Self reading (Not sure how to enable it on Deck, but it's usually V or S on keyboard)
+Warning and opt out of the one graphic segment of the game without losing content
+Consent is respected, no SA (although I've not played any bad routes yet).
+Dyslexic font and another sans font is available in settings.
+No sexually graphic scenes
-No opt out of sexual/sensual content, but it's very mild (no body sounds or visuals, moderate descriptions in one route)

The title is misleading, it is in no way shape or form Yaoi, nor is there any explicit text pertaining to the sexual relationships. I wanted to point this out because I consider it false advertising , the only explicit text could be considered to refer to the ""cannibalism"" . That being said the story isn't bad at all , I have play all 4 routes, it could have been a lot better it developed more. I would consider this a Light BL read with a little action and some Horror themes. You get kissing and snuggling in all routes , however it's a damn lie to say anything is described outside of having some nerve pills and lube, it is only implied and inferred. I wouldn't pay more than 10 dollars and don't buy the walkthrough it's a waste as there is a guide on here and there are maybe 8 choices each route of which only 4 affect your choices.",1,1672245694,2032,0,2

2495,1485190,"This is not as good as the novel. My second dislike with all Y Press Games is you can't name the character yourself. It kills the game for me, to be perfectly honest. It should only be ten dollars if there is no customization for the player of the games. I've played better visual novels for less and still got to name and somehow customize my character.",0,1651975679,502,0,14
2496,1485190,"Did I like the game? Yes! I really enjoyed it! The artwork's beautiful and I enjoyed the story and characters. Y Press is quite good at creating engaging stories, and this one was no exception. The drama and tension is real! I don't regret a single moment of time I spent playing it. 

Would I recommend it? Yes. If you enjoy the genre, go for it! 

Did it have any issues? Yes... but I feel that whatever issues I had won't necessarily be issues for others. 
The first problem I had was with the lack of choices. There's not a lot of them to begin with, so it was a bit frustrating to discover that a lot of them didn't make a difference at all. 

The second problem I had was with how it treated sexuality. Sure. Fine. I get 'gay for you' and the whole getting with a straight guy fantasy... but I can't help but feel it wasn't handled properly here. I'll give it a soft pass because much of it is explained in the setting - but it might not be to everyone's taste. 

The third problem - and it's tied to the second point - is the treatment of rape and consent. There's a number of instances that felt very, VERY iffy. Seriously. If you're triggered by potential non-consent, avoid!! You have been warned. But if you're not, and/or you have a certain kink, then by all means, there's one path here that's going to make you very happy. I'm still on the fence about how consent is treated here - but that's a ME problem, and not an issue with the game itself. It comes down to taste. 

Verdict? Suspend your belief for a little while and just enjoy the game for what it is. It really is a good story. All the paths have their moments. Some are better than others, with decent outcomes - though not all of them give you outcomes for every character. I really liked the characters, and he artwork is beautiful. As long as you know what you're getting into, there's no reason not to get this one if you're into gay visual novels. I'm sure you'll love it as much as I did!",1,1642808894,1015,0,8

The art is BEAUTIFUL, however there are a few glitches with the art in game. One of which is Jader's blushing art, it's cut off around his eyes. 
Another pro of this game is they don't waste a lot of time on the intimate scenes. You don't get full-on nudity, and I think that's beautiful. It's a very romantic game. The main character is also overcoming his own issues which adds onto the drama and romance. 
One con I can think of is how short the storylines can be. I wish there was a way to drag out Jader's storyline, but I understand why they made it shorter. The side storylines also kill you abruptly or tell you to take the right path. Maybe more work on those in future development would help too? 

Also I'm totally team Jader. Love his storyline, hate what happens to him in others though, haha. I'll be doing some fan art for this game if you look for it. :)

I don`t know what I was expecting after the black screen, but not that level of tame. All the violence, love, sex, gore, etc. is only implied or hinted at. It`s like the story writer and the visual artist were both told the basic premise and were left to decide by themselves how far they wanted to take it. I would have rated the story 16 and up and the visuals 12 and up. If you are looking for an adult story with adult content, look elsewhere.

The addition of a fourth route was really sweet though I haven't gotten to play it yet, at the time of writing this I have completed the main three routes and I have to say hands down Jader is my favorite for a variety of reasons. I think part of it is the way that he's portrayed as a sympathetic victim of his circumstances and not a cold blooded killer. Each of the love interests really do give you something to go on and I found myself rooting for each of them to succeed with the hard headed protagonist. When they finally did it was joyous!

The routes are very well done and have a twist on each of them. The art is my favorite part it's so well done. Especially in Zheng Li's route. His expression in a cut scene with Demetri held such an intense look and gaze that honestly made him so interesting.

2520,1484560,"Ecchi Spirit has a unique concept to it where you have to click spirits found on cursed girls, with gimmicks relating to what color order to click on them (fair warning: this game isn't super generous to the Red/Green Colorblind). There is some dialogue regarding these individuals and how they know each other, with some attempts at creating a legitimate background for the ""exorcism"" techniques used.

Upgrades in the game are based around making the girl lose her clothing, which actually has a gameplay benefit of you being able to more clearly see what type of spirits you are clicking on, thus making you more able to efficiently gain points. There are multiple positions the girls can be in and through dialogue options unlocked with them, you are able to eventually progress to the sex scene with each girl. The dialogue, while not a perfect translation, is able to be understood, which I count as a plus for these types of games.

The sex scenes are mildly interesting and have some audio, but are mainly the girl in a sex position. You don't see yourself or any model aside from the girl, and so immersion isn't exactly something you'll experience. I think the most ""excitement"" you'll experience will come primarily from just looking at their naked bodies while you continue gaining points to be able to move on to the next ""level.""

I think that the 3D modeling is pretty decent. Not phenomenal, but the girls are cute enough and I enjoyed that the gameplay was unique enough. I think that the relationship between the characters probably could have been worked on better since it is either very trope-y or dry, but it's hardly a complaint for a lewd game.

2529,1484580,"I am reviewing this game after 40 minutes of play or so.
I know, it doesn't seem like much.
But it was enough for me to know that this game, though it has a seemingly interesting story, has too many other issues for me to recommend it at this time. If the developer is able to work on and fix these issues, and updates come out to address them, I may change my review in the future.

No need for me to get into the plot of the game, lots of other reviews cover that.
I'll only go into the reasons I am not recommending the game at this time.

It runs terribly, even for a game built with Unity.
No optimization. None. 
Fps spikes galore, extreme load on both CPU and GPU, revving the fans up to near top speed,and pushing a ton f heat out. Neither my gaming laptop (MSI GS 75 Stealth 17 9750H/2070 RTX Max Q/16 GB DDR4 RAM) or my desktop (i9 9900K/2070 RTX Super/32 GB DDR4- fully water cooled) hit critical temps, but 80-90°C on both CPU and GPU was unexpected for such a simplistic game. 
Jenky camera- it would frequently spin around wildly while you are moving, or snap left or right with no mouse or keyboard input. That camera was all over the place at times.
Frequent clipping through walls and objects, often into the middle of ""solid"" objects like rocks.
Sprint up a hill and jump- you may find yourself above the invisible ceiling, walking on it, until you suddenly fall through it, back to the ground.
Frequent stutters and hitches.
Ran the game in Windows 10 20H2 natively, tried it in compatibility mode- no difference.

Honestly, it seems like it could be an enjoyable game, if it were better made and optimized.

The art and graphics reminded me of a few other games immediately. It looked like the same basic Unity Store assets and color palettes. The games it reminded me of were Heaven Forest/Heaven Forest- Night and a few other games made by that same dev who has a dozen accounts and names. No, you won't find them on Steam right now, they were pulled some time ago. The game looked, felt and  played (same bugs and optimization issues- exactly) as those games. That is not a good thing. Not at all.

I doubt I will attempt to fully complete this game, I prefer to not cook my hardware on something like this. 
But, as I said, if the developer manages to fix these major issues and push a few updates that allow the game to run a bit cooler and more smoothly- I may change my mind and give it another go. but until then I am uninstalling and shelving this one.
I think I paid 99¢ USD for the game, so it's not a huge loss. Just a bit of a disappointment considering some of the more positive reviews it seems to have gotten.",0,1627162945,36,0,319
2530,1484580,I know that the Steam community can be critical but these reviews are a bit harsh. This is a beautiful walking simulator and I do like the story. PS: Get your tissues out friends!,1,1616726480,115,0,58

2532,1484580,"Tried to give this game a chance. I don't mind walking simulators, slow paced games or even amateur-ish games. However, there's just too many issues with this game. No menu, no save option, no map, no skip button for the intro. And the game crashes over and over. I tried playing for about 20 minutes and it crashed on me five times. And since you cannot save, you have to start all over again.

I lowered the game's resolution in an attempt to get it to crash less but it didn't make a difference. Get an achievement? Crash. Autosave happens? Crash. Trigger an in game event? Crash. Run and then jump? Crash. 

I still wanted to soldier on and see if I could finish the game, so I went into the discussion boards to see if there was any word from the developer on the issue or an incoming patch. Nothing. Developer is no longer replying to people on Steam about how the game doesn't work. Some user posted a message the developer published on some other site of theirs saying they don't know how to code nor do they have any interesting in learning how to code, telling customers to google possible fixes to issues themselves instead. 

I gave up. This is the first time I've ever filed for a refund. From what little I got to play of the game, it's below average at best. You're basically getting an audiobook because you literally cannot do anything in game other than walk forward to trigger monologues. And the voice acting is not good. I had trouble understanding what was being said and there were very strange pauses in between a same sentence.

The game centers around a man who searches for his dog, Zack, after he has wondered off. As you traverse the land, you will discover things from your lifetime that revokes memories of the man's life.

The game is aesthetically pleasing to the eye, the environment becomes more surreal as you progress further and It starts to make more sense, the narrator is not to shabby in his voice acting, except for a few lines when he's more frantic. The gameplay can be relaxing to go trough, nothing trilling or heart pounding, just slow paced narration when you hit certain points that explains the protagonist's life story and his relationship with his dog and parents. It can feel a little dragged out as this is a walking simulator. The ending of the of the game will be a sad one, especially for those who've had dogs.

I give this a 9/10

Easy to get 100% achievements done in one gameplay so that's a bonus for us who likes that.

Negative point is that the game is made in that game engine (not a pro lol but enough experience from playing these games) that makes you run faster if you shift-strafe forward then just pressing shift+forward.

It's a difficult start if you're going in not knowing what to expect. So, if you go in with zero expectations, you will be blown away by the magic.

Maybe it's not the ultimate source of knowledge or has all the answers to life, but it does tell the tale of one man. It shares the emotions, fears, significant life events, and all the beauty there is to what makes a person.

I actually found a pretty solid game, if a bit simple overall.

So it's about fighting a gigantic mantis in the forest, and well... 
That's what you get. 
It's a giant mantis, and you have to fend it off with crap you pick up. Surprisingly, there's actually more to it than just wailing on it. it has some attack variety, you can parry some of them, and it's quick enough to require decent reaction speed while still being pretty fair. Good, if basic fight mechanics. 

And for a single dollar? Yeah, i don't see a reason to not pick this up and have a go at it.

2543,1484620,"I absolutely loved the first ""Arcade Spirits"". It was a fantastic game that broke a lot of stereotypes and although not every character was ""my type"", it was still a great experience.

Sadly, I just cannot say the same thing about this one. Which is super disappointing, because on paper, everything looks even better. I love the designs of the characters, their unique personalities, their strengths and flaws. The story seems bigger and better, especially with the addition of a rival. 

And seriously...

The rival is actually the saving grace of this title. Their route is really good, mostly because it's tied to the main story, has an interesting dynamic (you can choose friendly or aggressive rivalry) and feels the most... well... like dealing with a human being.
The rest though... Ech.

I will admit, I have a huge crush on Rhapsody. I didn't finish this route though, because I was so tired and discouraged after going for Domino and experiencing all the other characters along the way.

Yes, like one character says, everything is political. But if I had a friend, who on a daily basis, would just reiterate the same talking points and rants, I would go mad. I agree with almost everything that these characters believe in - although there were at least few problematic lines. And don't even get me started on first meeting Jinx - this s*it ain't funny. No decent person would react that way toward someone with a disability, so forcing the main character to be an as*hole was a questionable decision at best.

Those awesome characters? At least 50% of the time they don't feel like characters. They feel like talking heads, so developers/writers can rant about what bothers them. Sometimes it feels genuine. A lot of the time it feels preachy and forced. I AGREE WITH YOU. Can you just give me that option so we can move on and I don't have to read the same arguments over and over again? Seriously, I'm pretty sure most of your players have very progressive ideas. And if not, this BS certainly would not convince them. It's not ""eye-opening"", it's simply annoying.

To sum it up: Game tries to deal with a lot of serious issues, but it does so with the grace of an elephant. Main character is so bland that they almost disappear among others. Some situations make the main character look bad, just to make a point, without any regard to the player, who may be uncomfortable or experience similar problems in real life. Characters, despite interesting design and personality, feel like ranting puppets. Rival is good. Music is good. Story was okay. If there will be a continuation, I will probably buy it. Would I recommend this one to somebody?

No.",0,1655868394,577,0,122
2544,1484620,"After one full play through:

Pros:
- Fantastic aesthetic/mood
- Fantastic art and character designs (though if one is looking for more ""down to earth"" character designs you may want to give Arcade Spirits a try first)
- Characters feel like they have their own goals and drive alongside the MC
- Very inclusive in how the MC handles relationships and identity
- Engaging story that left me with choices that make sense and are accurate to their presentation, but not so predictable that the engagements feel solved before choosing
- Your romance feels like they have a more important role in this compared to Arcade Spirits and I have a much larger urge to go through with other romance options due to what possible interactions there could be with your SO
-While I can't speak for any other players, I truly felt like I could express my way of thinking through the narrative and dialogue options provided

Cons:
- This may be small, and it is much better than the first Arcade Spirits, but I do wish there were more hair/clothing customization options for the MC. The inclusivity for pronouns/body frame/sexuality are all fantastic and really lend well to you feeling like you can actually express yourself through the MC, but it can feel a tad for naught if you have physical features that fall outside of the current options such as hair type/length or a smaller frame but would like to have a wardrobe outside of a solid colour t-shirt or sweatshirt. One can't expect every physical attribute/style to be represented and accounted for, but it would be nice to have more options, especially when designing both yourself and your rival, and having those characters next to the wonderful intricate designs of the other characters.

Undecided:
- I was entirely not expecting Sungwon to be voice acting Domino. All I can think of is Domino trying 26 different flavours of peanut butter while ruminating about the existential, and apathetic cacophony that is the chaos of life. Y'know what, decided, 10/10",1,1653775835,1067,0,1

The protagonist is chosen to be an esports team manager and must make difficult decisions while trying to keep everyone on the team happy. In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. 

[u]Information[/u]
    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one. They just wouldn’t get some of the references, as some characters from the first game do make an appearance. 
    • The mini-game is super easy. If you fail, just reload (on the first playthrough). After the first playthrough, a new feature is unlocked to simply scroll back to try a different choice.
    • The Rival can be friendly or hostile. 
    • Romantic scenes are tame. Implied sex only. The Rival’s romance route is definitely the most risque in terms of dialogue. 
    • 7 romanceable characters: 3 women, 2 men, 1 enby, and the Rival (any gender). 

[u]Praises[/u]
    • Elaboration on the AI Iris’s origins that players probably wondered about in the first game.
    • Neat character creation setup. Protagonist & Rival.
    • Several pronoun options. 
    • Indicates whether a choice influences romance or not.
    • Personality traits like in the first game are back: quirky, steady, kind, gutsy, and flexible.
    • Amusing effects that company ridiculous jokes.
    • Disabled character representation. A [i]romanceable[/i] character who’s a gorgeous goth.
    • Characters are pleasantly racially diverse. 
    • Polyamory route.
    • Critiques of societal pressures and what exactly “success” means.
    • Various discussions of having toxic parents and other relatives.
    • Throughout the story, various social issues are brought up related to the gaming scene: from capitalist ventures like loot boxes to branding.
    • The game touches heavily on depression and suicide. As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)
    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.

[u]Complaints[/u]
    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.
    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.
    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. 
    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. 
    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.
    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. 

It seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. 

Despite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall. It was a lot of fun and very geeky.

2547,1484620,"Edit: Since posting this review and talking to other players, I've found my issues with the preachy, heavy-handed rants are a common complaint others have of the game, too. So it isn't just me.

This is another case of ""I wish Steam had a maybe button"", but as the price is £13, I'm going to be harsher and lean towards ""No, I don't recommend this game"". 

And that is largely because I preferred the first game. This game is bigger, longer and ""better"" than the first one, in almost every way, whilst still keeping the exact same UI that I enjoyed about the previous one. There's more of everything you enjoyed - the snarky humor, the interesting characters, the complex and delicate subject matter that does a good job of making you feel for the characters. 

My issue arises from the fact they've added more of something else, too. There feels like a lot more ""soapboxing"" in this game, peppered throughout. Some of it? Sure, fair enough. They're important matters to discuss and they're relevant to the game setting. But some of it really feels forced in it's handling, and I found myself going, ""Ok, that's nice and all, Locksley but I've been pressing 'next' for about 10 screens now, can we please stop talking about global warming and reminding me the economy is rubbish and I'm poor, please?""

This may not be an issue for most players, but like the MC, I use games as an escape from the real world. And there was just far too much rhetoric shoe-horned throughout the game. Especially for one so customisable and flexible, which then felt jarring when it forced me into these narratives and issues. I just want to woo some people, man. 

It really lost some of its predecessor's charm, and I felt myself detaching from the characters and the plot, and my eyes glazing over as we spoke more and more about things I actively avoid twitter to get away from seeing, because it's just depressing, honestly. 

And truly, the only one I really enjoyed romancing, aside from the barely-there Rival, was Domino. And even then, the game kept suggesting Domino was in the wrong for how he spoke and acted, often with him going ""oops, I did it again, didn't I?"" complete with creepy yandere face. When it was genuinely funny or enjoyable to see. And I disliked that I had no input on how my character reacted to it in the later scenes other than to tell them it's ""ok"" and push him into therapy the moment they started dating, because they ""care about him"". It just left a bad taste in my mouth that we immediately tried to fix the one character I very much enjoyed. But that is purely personal opinion, I suppose. 

Another thing was that I didn't like the partial voice acting. Especially with how scarce it got towards the end of the game. I understand budget etc, but I wish they'd had none or had full, or even kept up the quality of the partial towards the end. And I wasn't a huge fan of the lack of CGs, but that might be because I enjoyed them so much when they did appear. Along with that, I didn't like that our characters, and other characters made with the character creator were so obviously different to the original characters. It was jarring and took me out of it a lot.

And because there was just so much that I thought was either lazy, or shoehorned in, I feel like this game is living in the success of it's prequel. I liked the inclusivity, but sometimes I felt like it was there just to tick a box, or to make sure they had that certain gimmick involved. And that they were so focused on pushing a message, or every angle, that they really lacked what made the first so special to me. 

Of course, this is all my personal opinion, and I am a very overly critical person in general. You may enjoy it, so give this review a pinch of salt.",0,1653893854,935,0,147

Theoretically should be a lot of positives with it

- character customization
- available pronouns
- differing story routes at first glance
- potential polycule romance 


What actually happens

- political pushing, to an extreme
- poorly done caricature of generalization of gamers/reddit/ect which leads to jokes and choices that just.... aren't good 
- noticeable lack of depth to a LOT characters which leads to you just.... not caring about the actual story they have and are trying to tell
- the massive pushing of overbearing narrative of just... all of it that just feels repetitive and exhausting

Like I said with as1's writing can make or break a story especially for voice acting and you can TELL that they do and try but its just not... translating with the words they've been given to what we're supposed to want to feel for them.  There is no connection to the characters and it falls so far and is quite honestly disappointing comparing the two.

I did 5 of the available routes, and honestly I can't bring myself to try the rest because its just... Strenuous at best and jaded and tedious at worst.  

The only route I can even suggest to play is going to be the Rival, because that's the only I played that actually felt... Real.

The hours difference should tell you alone from mine at least - as1 had 60+ hours and as2 barely scratches 14 hours.  I 100% Arcade Spirits, and couldn't even finish all of the routes for Arcade Spirits : The New Challengers and honestly I don't know that I ever will.  And its just a bummer.",0,1692165012,847,0,5

It felt very over the top at times. It was hard to like a lot of the characters because they simply didn't feel realistic.

- pretty engaging storyline. i really liked following this where it went, and i appreciated more so in this game that it follows a recognizable path. there was a genuine ""climax"" that no matter whose route you take, if anyone's, you still arrive at the same major points.
- forgiving choices. i appreciated that the writers made clear that no matter who the player teams up with at the end, that the plan will work successfully in some way. it may have unexpected results, sure, but you can't pick a ""wrong"" plan.
- fun character designs. i know a lot of people had mixed feelings on them, but i liked their visuals more. they had a lot of color, some whimsy, and i genuinely wanted to know more about all of the characters. this leads me to my next point...
- more options, to me. in the first game, almost from the start i was sure who i wanted to romance, simply because i didn't really care about or even didn't like certain characters. i knew the one character i wanted to romance and i had no desire to romance any of the others, not really anyway. with this game, i actually had 3 potential candidates, of which i played routes for two (these being jynx and locksley). i was content with any one of these. (though... as much as i love the full capability to choose your romantic partner if you want to, it could be fun to put an option where you just let iris decide, based off her data. if you had multiple candidates like i did with pretty equal scores/success rates, she picks randomly or by other types of scoring.)

cons:
- less of the history, more of the social issues. the first game had a nice balance of the current overarching story with the characters and the history of the games in the arcade. this game felt less like i was learning more arcade history (not to mention it included discussion of a government conspiracy that i didn't know anything about, nor did the characters explain, so i felt really confused until i stopped the game for about 20 minutes to read up because the game assumed i knew what it was), and more so a significant reflection on major issues in gaming. i can agree that there are issues, i can agree there's issues even BEYOND gaming as a scope, but for five minutes i'd like to talk to locksley without him bringing up another huge social issue, even if that is part of his focus.
- speaking on locksley, what happened? his backstory felt very out of place, brought from nowhere, and i didn't see any indication of it prior to the actual scenes in which he explains at pengy's. i saw no implications that he had any struggles, and therefore it made it hard for me to believe and, worse still, made it hard for me to care. not to mention his romantic route was ... way too over-the-top, even for him. he does have the dramatic, showy personality... but i genuinely thought after the first time at pengy's and the player insisting he didn't have to do so much would have reoriented him to a calmer sort of approach. even the suggestion of marriage after a *month* of dating was a bit much.... i wanted to like locksley for the incredible loyalty he has and his desire to do good, but i found him shadowed by his own exaggerated personality via the writing and his continuous discussions of social issues.
- stigma. i've seen some people comment on the issues regarding the way suicide and mental health are presented in the game. i don't have a lot of thoughts that haven't already been mentioned, but the way in which that particular character's storyline was handled, not to mention the [spoiler]tampering with medication[/spoiler] issue, didn't really sit right to me. and, the post-scene wrap up was absolutely sudden and felt hollow. i genuinely think this particular moment would have been received better if it were a chance for whichever romantic interest (or highest friendship) to listen to the player and provide comfort or some type of gentle closure for this type of thing.
- i can see your tracks. i try not to look for it, and i make an effort to not worry too much about it if it happens from time to time, but oh gosh can i see the moments in which all the branches meet to the ""center"" again. 
- instructions unclear. i hope i'm not the only one who genuinely did not understand how to play the minigame at all. i wanted to play it though.

mixed:
- character customizer is much improved compared to last time, but i still didn't really feel 'connected' to my representation of myself in the game. i made it as close as i could to myself, but i found that there were ... not really a lot of options to make myself. so i felt like i was playing more a 'character' version of myself rather than a self-insert (as i typically play VNs).
- jynx and grace's connection. i understand that one of the options for jynx and grace [spoiler]is a polycule.[/spoiler] i have no qualms with that. however, i didn't understand why it felt that as i played through jynx's romantic route, i was somehow also dating grace. they're best friends, and i can respect that, but it felt like jynx and grace only talked about each other, only wanted to be around each other, and in some ways it made me feel like i was a homewrecker in an unclear friendship. their avoidance to say exactly what it is is understandable to an outsider or new person as the player is, but if i'm romantically interested in jynx, wouldn't she want to clarify what her and grace is/are, to make things clear?
- intervention. when hosting the intervention at domino's discretion, it seems certain pairs were chosen, and the player gets one of those pairs based off their highest friendship: [spoiler]locksley and zapper, jynx and grace, and domino and rhapsody. [/spoiler] my issue with this is twofold. firstly, it doesn't take into account the player's connections outside of their *highest* one. i was closest with locksley and jynx for both my playthroughs, and the deciding factor since they tied on the data was who i was romancing. this then determined who was the #2 for my intervention; you now see the issue though, yes? [spoiler] if my top relationships were with locksley and jynx, and i'm romancing jynx, the two who intervene are jynx and grace, despite my high relationship with (and therefore high perceptiveness to reason from) locksley. the same with locksley and zapper. [/spoiler] secondly, these pairings felt misaligned from the story. [spoiler] obviously, grace and jynx go together (see my above point), but why locksley and zapper? why domino and rhapsody? wouldn't it have made more sense to put zapper and rhapsody together, since they're roommates and seem to be closer friends than rhapsody is with domino and zapper with locksley? this also ties back to my prior comment about it being based off player data but only to an extent... it was fortunate for me that zapper was my #3 top relationship behind jynx and locksley... imagine if i didn't care at all about zapper or found her too intense? half the team's efforts in convincing me would fall on deaf ears, even though the player character would end up agreeing anyway. [/spoiler]
- no bff. why don't i get a best friend? i can have high relationship with someone while also dating someone else, and that should feel different than someone i have less relationship with.",1,1655693709,754,0,2

2559,1484620,"Note: As of the time of posting this review, I have not actually finished the game, only gotten through part of Level 6.

This game isn't bad, exactly; it was clearly made with love, and there are several parts of it that I've enjoyed! But I wouldn’t recommend it to others, not unless I knew someone didn't mind a game trying to tackle heavy issues all the time, because for me, it was too much.

In the First Arcade Spirits game (which I love, despite its flaws!) my character first joined the arcade as a floor attendant, then progressed upward in a way that felt natural. They had the time to get to know everyone, gain their trust, make friends. This game's protagonist doesn't have that. Iris thrusts them into a tightly knit friend group in which they know nobody, and by the end of the day, when they barely know these folks, they're told they should become their manager. Even though they have no past experience whatsoever. Most of the team is frankly mocking them; Rhapsody pointing out what a difficult task this is and how they'd never do it themself, Domino already dismissing it as hopeless (admittedly that's just his whole deal), Loxley making it clear the protagonist could only pretend to have this ""power"" so long as they did what the team liked, and so on. I know this is just how I read these lines and that they were not meant to be this cruel, but regardless, it felt less like the character was being encouraged to ""follow their dreams"" of being a professional gamer, and more like they were being tricked into doing a bunch of extra work by people who didn't want to bother with it themselves, by being told that this was just what being an adult was like. Of course, they could just focus on what they're good at, being a gamer, but that leads to the petty ""good ending"" where the devs punish you for daring to stray outside the path (admittedly also a thing in the first game).

Iris was a cool character in the first game and there is still a lot about her that I enjoy. However, in New Challengers she comes across as far more ... pushy. The biggest example of this is her being an armchair psychologist for the player, diagnosing them with ""mental health issues"". She used that wording several times and brought it up even in the most inappropriate moments. Regardless of what the protagonist might be dealing with, her deciding they have a problem and basically forcing them to fix it, or congratulating them for doing better with this problem that she personally decided they have? That's not a healthy way to handle this! I'm fine with playing a character that's been dealing with ""mental health issues"" and knows it. But please, leave the diagnosing to that character and/or the medical professionals they willingly visit.

  On the gameplay side, I soon grew annoyed by just how many times I was asked what character I was romantically interested in. Once by Ben and Matt in an admittedly optional scene, then I believe four times by Iris. Sometimes my previous answers weren't acknowledged at all, but even when they were, they were immediately questioned again. That is not good game design. Even worse is awarding points with the chosen romantic interest each time, points that should be reserved only for actually earning their affection. I can understand how having a similar personality might lead to bonus points, but why this? Why do something that makes it possible to gain a high score with a character even while barely ever saying things they like? You can't actually make someone go out with you by just unrequitedly loving them so hard that they start to love you back.

And the less said about the FoD2 minigame, the better. Given how complex the actual game is, I would have expected something more strategic, rather than rock-paper-scissors. The devs succeeded at making sure I found every win joyless, but not for the right reasons. I just couldn't have any fun when no skill at all was required. All so the minigame would be easier to rig for that one hopeless fight where you could not score a single point, because ... never mind realism, a moral needs to be beaten into our heads.

I love how accessible Fiction Factory's games are! With not only the built-in text to speech support but some image descriptions and convenience features, they've truly done their best to make sure that even blind players like me can still fully enjoy the stories. And I do appreciate their intentions in including a disabled character, something that is still incredibly uncommon. And yet my feelings about Jynx are ... mixed. I love her personality; I had no idea how a steady/gutsy combination would work, but oh does it work well for her, and I adore her direct and confident attitude. However, right from the start, the writers' approach to handling her disability let me down, with me being forced to pick between four [b]equally[b] ableist conversation options that, rather than being clear about their content, were ranked by their supposed wrongness. I realised right away that this storyline did not have us disabled players in mind, but rather the kind of abled people that had never encountered a disabled person before. But I liked Jynx as a character, so despite expecting I might get stabbed in my own low self-worth issues, I kept getting closer to her anyway. And I was right; so far, it's been pretty sad. I respect the writers for trying to be realistic about disabled life, as well as avoiding the trope of inspiration porn. But they might have avoided it too much, to the point where Jynx too rarely had a chance to experience some disabled joy. I wish they could've at least given her a perfect first date. I don't care how unrealistic that would be; she deserves that much, damn it! I do not know how well the other romance options in this game pan out, so perhaps things are harsher and edgier over all here, but in AS1 all first dates were pleasant enough with only minor setbacks, and damn it, us disabled folks deserve to have that too! Even if just in fiction …

But perhaps New Challengers indeed is harsher overall, because it certainly feels that way. There are too few moments when the characters can just relax and be together, without any arguments, difficult discussions, or threats looming in the distance. Even Level 5, which should have been a fun day in the amusement park, did not have the relieving nature of the beach chapter in AS1, not with Valkyrie's threats putting the next chapter's battle foremost in my mind. Then there are all the times the game tries to educate players on ableism, bullying, capitalism and exploitation, human (and AI) rights, parental abuse, societal inequality, toxicity within gaming, ... All these are topics that I normally enjoy learning about, even when the issues are examined in far more detail than here. Perhaps I did not expect so much of it here, not even after reading the content warnings. I expected something like the first AS, which while deeper than initially expected maintained a good balance between light-heartedness and realism for a dating sim VN. New Challengers' insistence on tackling so many complex issues while still trying to have the same atmosphere lead to overwhelm, as well as the portrayal of some situations as black and white when they should be far more complex frustrating me, where I could easily forgive the first game for its cliche final villain.

Despite my complaints, there is still a lot to love here. The variety and inclusiveness is still incredible! The voice actors did a great job, and it is a shame the budget did not allow for more voiced lines. Besides Jynx, I’ve really enjoyed interacting with the chaotic ball of energy that is Zapper, as well as the rival, who is a LOT more likeable than AS1’s Juniper. Still, trying to play New Challengers, without fail, leaves me sad – and not in a good way.",0,1703953819,1280,0,3

The diverse and inclusive characters, conversations, and MC creation options enhance the well-rounded and engaging world by making it even more welcoming.

2562,1484620,"I love the arcade spirits franchise. It's cozy and queer and is ultimately a love letter to the gaming community that plays it. That being said, there are some things that I loved about new challengers, and some things that I didn't really love. 

Some of the things that I didn't love was how heavy handed and 'on-the-nose' some of dialogue is. The game can be kind of preachy sometimes, and can make the mistake of telling us instead of showing us some of it's ideals. The dialogue can be realistic in parts, but I found it and some of the routes to be lacking in beleivability that this is how all of their conversations go.

However, some of the things that I loved were  [spoiler] the contiuation of the polybius storyline, as well as polybiris [/spoiler]. I also loved that charcters, for the most part, when they weren't being so preachy it kind of sucked the enjoyment out of it. Theres lots of room for chaos and mayhem in this one, the stakes just continuing to get higher.

I romanced Grace but it never felt like we were really romanced at all.

2567,1484620,"Honestly? It's not as good as the first Arcade Spirits. That will remain complete lightning in a bottle genius. How you feel about esports likely will influence how you feel about this game, it's what drives the plot after all. Personally, I fucking hate competitive gaming, expletive fully intended. I don't want to play that shit, let alone even watch it. However, the writing really starts to come through at the start of the 6th chapter until the end of the game. So while I really struggled to identify with the struggles of this protagonist for most of the game, a strong final 3rd is something not a lot of games can lay claim to. 

Ignoring FoD2 (the esport), in terms of plot, the cast of the game is pretty good with some very nice character moments throughout. Some nice call backs from the first game even, although not every one makes a return, sadly. I've only played through once, so far, romancing the rival you get some control over. You get to design them like your protagonist and then choose whether you have a hostile or friendly starting point. That was nice and for story had so many twists I genuinely was not expecting. Going back for my last point, the other romance-able cast are pretty good even as friends. I think I'll play at least one more time to see the Chaos Iris and it will be hard choosing for the romance. I only really disliked Locksley, who is surprisingly popular, so what do I know. 

All and all, I would say it was good. Even if I really struggled to feel engaged for the first few chapters. The FoD minigame was really easy and, without struggling or reloading, won every match. So I would advise disabling it on any repeat play-through to see new content you would miss by winning. Anyway, buy it, play it, but don't expect it to be better than the first.

Worth it if you've never played the first game, or maybe more so if you've played and love the first game already. 

If I had to break the two down, I'd do it this way:

First game = cozy vibe, low stakes and personal growth. It's a tale of self-discovery.

Second game = high stakes, and a somehow heavier story that deals with self-doubt. 

This one was a little hard for me in places because like the MC, I struggle with judging myself critically. Thankfully, there's an emphasis on self-love and knowing what's really important in life. And this story really resonated with me.",1,1660499946,1013,0,79

Minor grievance. Everything else was fun.

But do not approach this game with any apprehension, The New Challengers is, against all odds, even better! You will be absolutely charmed and thrilled by this indie gem that has some of the best writing I have ever encountered, delightfully retro yet modern and vibrant aesthetics, and fantastic dating sim gameplays.

[b]A Word Is Worth a Thousand Pictures[/b]

In my view, no matter how many shiny things you surround the text with, you cannot camouflage bad writing in a visual novel. And likewise, a great story can effortlessly carry the player from beginning to end with the sheer power of words. This is exactly what the first Arcade Spirits did, and what this one does – and even better, to a certain extent. In this installment, you play as, once again, a young adult in a semi-existential crisis, at crossroads in their life with a big dream, in a euchronic future where arcades have not fallen out of fashion, and instead, have only risen in popularity (if only!). This time, rather than try and run an arcade in a ruthlessly capitalistic society, you want to make it into the hyper-competitive world of esports in a game called Fist of Discomfort 2 – connoisseurs will recognize this game from the first Arcade Spirits! — with the help of your AI companion Iris and teammates you will learn to love (platonically and/or romantically, your have the complete freedom to pursue any or no relationship type). You drive the narrative with the mere power of decision-making in the form of dialogue options in this visual novel that is halfway between a choices-matter game and a dating sim, while still retaining its unique aura and sense of artistry. It truly has a heart and soul that is beyond any constraining boxes and labels of genre.

What made the first Arcade Spirits shine amongst a plethora of good indie visual novels is not only the brilliancy of the textual and visual narrative it carries, but also the richness and diversity of its characters. None of the characters felt flat, they were all quite multilayered, likeable, and relatable to various extents. I didn’t think it was possible, but The New Challengers does this even better. You will not want to put the game down; this visual novel is a virtual page-turner!

[b]A Vibrant Cast of Friends and Enemies[/b]

Another tour de force of this game is rejuvenating the game while keeping and honoring the Arcade Spirits core that all the fans adore. I can imagine it must have been an incredibly difficult balancing act which was masterfully achieved. The characters are again the heart and motor of the game, and we still find the same(-ish) five personality traits: kind, quirky, gutsy, steady, and flexible, that you can develop and increase in an RPG-esque manner depending on your choices. We meet six completely new characters to befriend (or not) and romance (or not), with very fresh, diverse, and multilayered personalities that do not fall into clichés or easy tropes, and are not simply direct counterparts of the characters of the first game. And as much I loved (and loved to hate) the characters from the previous game, these ones are growing on me even faster... Even Iris now has more personality, on a scale between chaotic and orderly depending on your choices throughout the game.

One aspect I particularly appreciate is the malleability of the protagonist, and the diversity and richness of all characters – one character uses they/them pronouns, Ben and Matt are an adorable husband and husband pair, one character has a physical disability, and a variety of body sizes, styles, skin colors, and gender configurations are represented. The best part is that it does not feel forced in, all of these identity markers are carefully imbricated into personality and interact within a constellation of other traits. Diversity is never plastered in or vapid, it enriches personality and narrative. Moreover, this time around, not only can you romance any (or none — which is made clear to be just as valid a choice) of the six characters, you also get to have a face and body of your own (of the shape and configuration you want) that shows up on screen, making scenes much more dynamic, less static; a vibrant icon that represents your online persona; and you choose amongst 15 different sets of pronouns. Arcade Spirits: The New Challengers offers a masterclass in representation.

[b]Let your Personality Shine Bright![/b]

Beyond the endearing story and characters, you will certainly fall in love with the visual and auditory aesthetics. The vivid colors, the very clean art, and the satisfying sound effects all contribute towards modern retro aesthetics that are very pleasing to the eye and ear, topped off with bits of voice over dialogues. They capture the setting and atmosphere of the game so well, as it is set in parallel future that is rooted in the proliferation of the arcade era, a happy marriage between the late eighties and futuristic elements. It will make your nostalgic heart happy from the moment you boot up the game and are faced with a VHS-inspired interface and Windows 95 boxes, but with a resolutely modern and fresh twist.

The biggest addition to the game from its preceding installment is the addition of a Fist of Discomfort 2 mini-game. You remember that game that QueenBee was very fond of? Now you get to not only make your dream of being a champion of that game come true, but also play it yourself in the form of a little side game. I found myself truly enjoying this mini-game that is simple enough to not distract from the main game and not weigh it down, and engaging enough to make it a lovely intermission, a playful side-quest and punctuation in the narrative. And if it’s not your cup of tea, you can choose to skip it entirely without consequences.

[b]A Delight from Beginning to End![/b]

For all the reasons mentioned above, I cannot recommend Arcade Spirits: The New Challengers more heartily. As a big fan of the first game, I was excited yet apprehensive about this new installment (not a sequel per se, a fresh new game that retains its predecessor’s soul and charms), thinking it could not possibly live up to my expectations. However, I was ecstatic to realize that it does not fall short in any single aspect. Everything you loved about the first game is back but better, with some completely new additions as well that rejuvenate the game. Like its predecessor, all of the aesthetic, narrative, and gameplay components combine and have this enchanting je-ne-sais-quoi that captivates you and makes you forget all your woes. It will make your little queer heart squee in joy and it will carry you away to its lovely nostalgic world, whether you’ve played the first Arcade Spirits or not. 

If visual novels, choices-matter games, and dating sims are up your alley, you must do yourself a favor and add this gem to your collection. You won’t be able to put the game down until you’re done with it, and then, you’ll just want to play it again to try different romance, friendship, and career options. Go and show Fist of Discomfort 2 who’s boss!",1,1653964082,21,0,15

2581,1484620,"Disclosure: I'm an involved member of the Loading Ready Run community, which puts me in a kind-of, sort-of, occasionally, on the internet, with some sporadic snail mail exchanged, personal relationship with Graham Stark and Jacob Burgess, who voice a pair of characters in the game and, in Mr Burgess's case, casted and directed the voice actors and, I believe, is involved with the publishing company. I have made these gentlemen giggle on camera on at least a few occasions each. They have each made my whole day with their comedic efforts more times than I can count. So we know I'm not an entirely unbiased party.

With that in mind, I think Arcade Spirits and its sequel are two astonishing games. Playing either of them is like a warm hug when you're getting the shakes from not being touched for many years. They are funny and thoughtful stories that involve you on a personal level as you try to navigate a world of having multiple really nice people in your life who all want you to be happy and fulfilled and want to work with you to provide a space for you weirdos to live as your honest, unique selves.

The games have a lot to tell us about freedom and consent and respect and trust and courage and hope and love. And a lot of those things are, in my opinion, vitally important things. And the games say them with a great deal of wit and humor and personal conviction. I feel it in my heart. I spend hours constructing imaginary conversations where my player character says the things I want to say to her lovers, and then the game - in many cases - lets me say [i]those very things[/i], if somewhat compacted, but with the same general thrust. Half the time worded better than what I'd come up with. These games agree with me, fundamentally, personally, in all the impossible and important things I believe about fairness and honesty and the absence of loneliness, so of course I love it.

It's perhaps hard to understand for people who aren't outcast, who have jobs and gender identities and neuropsychological conditions that allow them to fit in with the dominant culture without question. But for everyone else, for everyone who doesn't fit in, I think the question isn't if we want to play these games.

[h2]TLDR: A VN for fans of video games and video game history. I liked it, and I imagine most others will too! [/h2]
[h3][b]The Good:[/b][/h3]
-	 [b][u] Characters:[/u][/b] I really enjoyed all of the characters. It was compelling to see the ways the character’s defined themselves, and how that fed into their ‘stress moment.’ No matter who you spend time with, they will have a unique approach to the situation, as well as personal experience that can affect the plot. In addition, their individuality made friendship feel as worthwhile as the romantic elements of the game.
- [b][u] Video Games: [/u][/b] You don’t need extra knowledge about video game history, or industry trends/issues, but you will certainly appreciate this game more if you have it. It’s always cool to see how much people love the topics they make games around.
- [b][u] Inclusivity: [/u][/b] The romantic options reflects the current gaming consumers, with diversity across race, gender, ability, class and so on. As a side note: I really appreciate that this game showed how diverse the interest in gaming was. Like there can be a world of separation between people who like shoot-em-ups and racing games, but they share a love for games which centers them both. There was also a strategist! There’s never a strategist! I did wonder why the strategist wasn’t the coach, but oh well.
- [b][u] Hot Topics: [/u][/b] As I pointed to above, the game addresses ableism, misogyny, racism and gatekeeping as just a few of the things currently plaguing the industry. This made me really appreciate how much thought was put into putting this game together.
- [b][u] Character Creator: [/u][/b] I like that there was a character creator! It felt important in this game to be able to present the main character in a variety of ways.
- [b][u] Artwork: [/u][/b] The art looks really neat! I didn’t know how much I liked neon until playing this lol.
- [b][u] Music: [/u][/b] Don’t @ me, but I play games with the music off. I’ve heard it’s great though, so that’s something to keep in mind.
- [b][u] Winning: [/u][/b] I'm going to stick with the less-is-more idea for this one, but I really like that the game asks why is winning so important to you, and what do you actually achieve when you're winning. It's definitely a question worth asking!

[h3][b]The Not So Good: [/b][/h3]
- [b][u] Character Creator: [/u][/b] Has kind of limited options. It’s really noticeable in comparison to the characters that get sprites. Sometimes the “bad” characters also have generated character (characters created through the character creator), and it kind of made my main character feel a bit ‘less than’ the main cast. I get that it would be more effort to add additional shading to give the main character more dimension and personality, but I definitely would have been more compelled. In addition, there aren’t many natural hair options (which always kind of stinks).
- [b][u] Sprites (sometimes): [/u][/b] Sprites can be unsettlingly exaggerated. I wouldn’t expect this to bother anyone, and the game leans into its humorous side so it isn’t out of nowhere. It was just strange.
[h3][b]Suggestions for New Players: [/b][/h3]

2588,1484620,"I'm pleased to report that--going by what I've played so far--Arcade Spirits continues to easily be the best you can find in dating sims, and one of the best in visual novels on the whole. the first game is without question the best dating sim I've played, because it basically does everything right. excellent writing that is extremely inclusive and frequently hilarious, fun characters that don't just feel like stock waifus/husbandos/thembos/whatever, lovely art, and a cozy atmosphere. characters in Arcade Spirits may be ""playersexual"", but they aren't dead-eyed sex dolls--they'll tell you off if you do something rude, thoughtless, pushy--which makes the romance (or aromance, if you'd prefer) far more comfortable to engage with as a player since it doesn't feel like the characters are just DYING for you to boink 'em. you also don't have moments where unclear language in the choices lead to you making decisions that you wouldn't have if you'd known right. but if you do something so dire, intentionally pissing a character off, you may not get what you want if that's who you wanted to shag.

this sequel, The New Challengers, continues all of that, but does some interesting new things. Jynx is great representation for someone who is physically disabled, and really relatable. she doesn't want to be pitied or marveled at for living as a disabled woman. prime example of a character who will make you feel like ass for putting your foot in your mouth (tho the game literally warns you that that's what you'll do), and it makes her much more someone I want to root for as she is not passive when it comes to ableism.

Matt & Ben remain, bar none, the funniest couple in video games. I adore these two, the fact that these hubbies run a fucking arcade/pizzeria/laundromat is already just diabolically funny, but they continue to have some wickedly fun lines that I want to bottle like nectar. the rest of the new cast, aside from Jynx, all seem very amusing and affable--and I also really like how they have continued to make your character actually have a story of your own. while you dictate your personality and the answers to the thematic questions posed by your arc, YOU HAVE AN ARC. you aren't just some sex-fiend coming in to plow all in sundry (though you are probably a sex-fiend coming in to plow all in sundry too). I also cannot stress enough how much I love that this game lets you choose to be aromantic and/or asexual. I don't tend to RP in games as either, but IRL, I am an aromantic dude infinitely more fond of platonic relationships, and I like that I don't have to have romance shoved down my throat if I don't want to. (with a good dating sim tho, it's a fun way of playing around with alloromanticism in a way that I have no interest in, in real life. at least, in my experience.) for those who do want romance shoved down your throats--you'll enjoy frollicking throughout The New Challengers, for sure.

as for improvements, I did encounter one typo, and one ""o"" that was smaller than the rest of the word it was in--and, in context, I don't see why that would've been an intentional decision.

that being said, I clearly think this game is absolutely fuckin' worthy of picking up--and if you haven't already snagged Arcade Spirits 1, I'd highly suggest you do so. it's a ball. I have not played enough to tell whether The New Challengers will be equal to or surpass AS1 in my mind--I really do still have such a glowing reception to that game--but I love that this series continues to provide such positive reception to so many marginalized groups in a way that feels heartfelt, but also natural. like it shouldn't be weird that people from marginalized groups might be friends, might be interested in one another. because it really shouldn't be!

Arcade Spirits: The New Challengers flings you face-first into this glorious dystopia, where button-mashing, joystick-wielding mayhem is the path to true purpose. Forget saving the world – you're here to become an esports LEGEND!

Remember when the idea of finding love and glory inside an arcade seemed far-fetched? Well, that was before The New Challengers stormed onto the scene! You play a misunderstood underdog with dreams way bigger than your sad apartment. Tired of being a gaming gremlin, you decide life needs more…PIZZAZZ. So, naturally, you throw yourself into the esports gauntlet in the only way you know how – pure, unfiltered heart!

Forget about complex strategies and dull competition.  The New Challengers is a rainbow-colored journey of sheer unbridled chaos sprinkled with self-discovery and more cheese than a supreme pizza! As you bond with your ragtag team of misfits, you'll realize that friendship is the ultimate cheat code! Teamwork? Overrated!  Emotional depth? Absolutely necessary! Romance? It's like an extra pepperoni– unexpected but absolutely scrumptious!

Get those claw-grip fingerless gloves ready, because you're about to battle your way through ""Fist of Discomfort 2,"" the game-within-the-game that's so deliciously ridiculous you'll laugh your way to victory! The true heart of the game lies in the moments between epic fights and late-night pizza bagel binges. The characters will sweep you away with their hilarious quirks and hidden depths.

Oh, and did I mention the AI overlords? Because, in The New Challengers,  AI isn't a threat, it's your bestie! Imagine befriending an AI with more wit and sass than your entire gaming squad. Suddenly, world domination just seems like a fun bonus mission!

The Verdict? Forget your energy drinks and noise-canceling headphones! Arcade Spirits: The New Challengers is a pure, concentrated sugar rush disguised as a game. It's a heartfelt reminder that friendships and pizza bagels make any impossible dream seem within reach…except the treasure at the end - it's all the friends you made along the way!

2599,1484620,"Overall, TNC isn't better or worse than AS1. And anything done better or worse I've found to be opinionated for the most part. Lets start with what I think it does better. Customization. Yeah that's about it. But there are a few ""two way street"" stuff I would say it has. First off the characters. They are in depth in terms of they are a whole lot of two things. It's ""hey this is what I am but look at this other not really important and probably never discussed again beyond a brief mention side of me."" And not even that much can be said for every character. It's not exactly a bad thing as what they do show is fun and sad and they still feel like people. But I feel like it falls to heavily into the persona act. Except for a few exceptions. It also seems like more effort has been put into some more than others as it was just harder to engage with some characters over others. And the story. It's longer but falls short of anything it seems like it was trying to hit. It doesn't have the same charm. It's not even all that cute this time. Hardly quirky most of the time. It tries to dive into deeper topics but ultimately you get nothing from it. ""Suicide is bad."" ""It's not your fault."" ""We accept you the way you are."" That is all I can get from this. The first few chapters feel like a good setup to something completely different. however a good thing I can say about the story is the way it represents mental illness such as depression, imposter syndrome and what not are handled and portrayed well and accurately. I feel like it really wants to tell you something but is full of unfinished thoughts. And just like the last game it's about good for 1-2 playthroughs until it gets really repetitive. Ultimately it comes together in a superglue and duct tape sort of way but especially after getting into the politics the game is trying to embody and almost forcing at times, it is only for a certain group of people. And that's probably the only bad I can see out of this. Like it wants to fit in with the kids and so it leans a little more this way. I'd say it could be ignored if that wasn't what half the game was about. I don't think I've ever played a game so deep yet so shallow. I still praise it on what it does well but just like the last one it's not much more than an decent story with decent characters.",0,1704839012,1536,0,65

Arcade Spirits: The New Challengers is a sequel to Arcade Spirits. I came off Arcade Spirits wanting to continue the story of... Arcade Spirits. This new sequel is... how you say... tastefully interesting.

Firstly, none of the characters I find are bad bad per say... but I find them less interesting than the original? I find myself trying to befriend them instead of romancing them, whereas in the original, there are clear cut and very versatile dates you can choose from. I can kinda see the direction they were going in... but I much prefer the old setting where people worked at a arcade to achieve their dreams and then the story revolves around that... it feels more... interesting... I don't know, I can't exactly describe what's missing from this.

But I am glad for many different aspects of the game. The voice acting, the story choices feel meaningful, artwork is always fantastic, character customization is a step up, everything is an improvement. So, I think if you like the original, go get the sequel.",1,1703597072,299,0,149

It goes without saying, but since this is a visual novel it involves a lot of reading and the gameplay is just choose-you-own-adventure branching decisions, so as much as I enjoy the game, if you're not a fan of that style it's best to look elsewhere.",1,1668440604,9759,0,4

i have the same complaint a lot of people do. sometimes, talking with locksley or jynx, the game feels a lot like it's shoveling and shoehorning in being progressive. im cool and i like what the game says, i just wish it was implemented a bit more naturally. especially jynx's first conversation with the MC. i certainly felt like that could've been handled better, as a disabled person. 

otherwise, im really enjoying it so far. props for the multitude of pronoun options. it's always good to see myself be represented in a game or elsewhere.

2626,1484620,"Sweet and funny, and an amazing follow-up to the original Arcade Spirits.

The story did some cool things with pieces set up in the first game, while also telling its own story with a fantastic and lovable cast of characters. I'm going to save it for later, since I'm kind of trying to keep replaying (or eternity-playing) games to a minimum this year, but I did want to immediately go back and try Zapper's romance route. ONE DAY! (I still find it very neat that she remained a romance option all the way up to when you have to choose who to ask out, even while the game acknowledged that our personalities were basically opposites.)

Oh, and romance SPOILER:

There's a poly route.

It's Grace and Jynx. Who are both amazing, and I love them.

there is so much to love about this game so if you're considering buying it, i recommend it to all of my friends as well. 

a few of the best features of this game:
-the soundtrack is so cool! you can check it out on spotify too which is nice since a lot of games do not make theirs available or only offer it for purchase
-amazing art!! i love seeing the gallery photos you can unlock. it's really fun as an artist to be able to see game designers show off their early developmental stage sketches. i like seeing the progress. the fanservice for locksley is also very good lol o\\\o
-disability rep!! jynx is a dynamic character and i love her cane. i am also disabled and it was cool to see a more realistic disabled character who wasn't merely there as the ""token crip""
-poly/queer relationship routes!
-a diverse cast! very cool to see SO SO much representation throughout the series. if you're interested in playing the new challengers i would HIGHLY recommend it, but also the first arcade spirits!you can play them out of order but it's cool to play the first one first since there's some cameos/easter eggs throughout that you can appreciate more after playing through the first

there are only a few suggestions/asks i can think of. the first is please make hamza/some of the ""side characters"" romancable! it would be so cool to see a few secret routes outside of the main characters!! i loved that you could ""stall"" hamza by asking him on a date in one of the chapters, but would have loved for it to go beyond that. 
the second suggestion/ask is i think more character design is always better! i knowgame art is time consuming so i understand why the mc's clothes/options have been kept simple, but it would be rad to see some more options in future games or updates! 
anyway, secret routes are awesome! this game is awesome!! please keep making more!!",1,1660791295,2206,0,2

The game offers a total of ""only"" 7 different pictures, but 5 levels of difficulty and a hidden puzzle.

As with [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1346250/]Neko's Journey[/url], everything is included, from relaxing to pro mode.
The differences in the modes are that the Relaxing mode has 9, the Easy mode has 16, the Fun mode has 25, the Challenging mode has 36 and the Pro mode has 81 puzzle pieces.

It's a really fun game and not to be underestimated, at least as far as the more difficult modes are concerned.
A successful change for in between.

2649,1483940,"[h1]A Fun, Moving Collection[/h1]

[i]Slide Stories: Bonds & Memories[/i] is a collection of eight slider puzzles that tell a story and reflect on memories. There are seven standard puzzles and an eighth bonus puzzle that you can find (which was a pretty cool feature). The puzzles are available in different sizes: 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, and 9x9.

I really enjoy the hand-drawn images and the story they tell. The pictures are animated rather than still. Though I like the idea of animation (and really enjoyed it in the first collection of slide puzzles, [i]Slide Stories: Neko's Journey[/i]) I did find the animation to be a bit too much: it felt like each image was persistently [i]shaking[/i] and I often found myself feeling rather nauseated. That was really unfortunate. I would suggest, in this case, to have an option to freeze the animation. Maybe in future collections revert back to the fewer animations from the other collection.

The music is really relaxing. It's a soft and soothing melody, and perfectly complements the story being told. I wouldn't mind a few more tracks (it's one single tune that repeats and is used for all puzzles as well as the main screen). It is nice as it is, but variety is good, too.

Some of the great features that are included in the [i]Slide Stories[/i] series are the options to number your puzzle pieces and looking at the completed picture. Numbering the pieces is really handy on the high piece counts where it's hard to distinguish differences between similar looking pieces: the numbers set you straight as to the order they need to be placed in. The option to look at the completed image is handy if you want a simple reference to look at as you work to complete the image.

Overall, I think it's a fun game. If you like slider puzzles, I think you will enjoy this set. The images are lovely and the story is very moving. It's well done (despite my slight dislike of the over-animation). I recommend this puzzle set, and look forward to seeing more in the future!",1,1609810561,497,0,16

The games a great idea, and it plays... ok. BUT!! There are some PROBLEMS! So I thought It would be good sport to request a lot more thing. Let's go
[list]
    [*]Make a arena mode!! Like were you have enemies (and you!) fight to the death
    [*]Biomes! Have biomes like Snow, Forest, Swamp, etc. In the biomes you could have different things spawn, which would solve the problem of overcrowding without removing anything.
    [*]Rather then whatever you're doing to generate an infinite world But I suggest have a certain amount of land and loop it when the player reaches the end of it. That way it could technically be infinite without having to auto-generate biomes.
    [*]Let me build a fortress to protect myself from the enemies!

You also cannot tell what option has been selected in the options menu. Another issue is that you cannot save the game, nor are there any checkpoints. If you die, you must start the entire game over. Other issues are that you must press the left mouse to start mouse free look, you cannot disable the highly inappropriate pounding techno music in the first level, performance is awful, voice acting is atrocious, and combat is a joke where you wildly swing a blade past enemies.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3286157467

I found the acting mediocre. The protagonist's reactions are unrealistic. She doesn't look distressed at all, not even her friend, who suspected she had been missing but didn't intervene or call the police. The plot felt rushed, and you barely got engaged or felt sorry for anyone. The soundtrack didn't give any depth or even noticeable. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3286161822

You get to solve a puzzle in each room you walk in, mostly finding floating letters on the wall and decoding a lock; those are simple and feel repetitive. There is also no time limit except for the last puzzle. Again, the choices have no real consequences except for the last bit of the game.

There is a manual save, only three slots, showing how far you are in the story in percentage. You can fast-forward the scenes as you play, which is an excellent advantage if you want to experience different endings.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3286160487

Pros:
+OK story with two endings.
+360 camera view to explore the place.
+Ok puzzles, one of them timed
+You can fast-forward the scenes. (Good for replying to the game and getting the other ending)
+Manual save.(Three slots)
+Mystery story.

Cons:
-Mediocre acting.
-Not all choices matter.
-No reply value.
-No steam achievement. 

As I said before, it is not a bad game. I enjoyed playing it and wondered who the kidnapper was, but I wouldn't play it again.  The whole game took me almost two hours, with two endings. I highly recommend buying it at a discount.

If you could develop a model similar to the Assassin's Creed Origins Discovery Tour in the future, I think it would be a great success. As someone who has a PhD in the field of tourism, my suggestion would be to add a narrated guide to the game.

Goons: Legends & Mayhem is a game about gooning with your friends, or without your friends, on the ice with some legends and mayhem. This is a great way to stay up all night gooning or even for a cheeky morning goon sesh. 

Goons comes with an extensive single player adventure for those lone wolf gooners and has plenty of cosmetics and items to get into for those long-time gooners who want more long term replayability in their sports games.",1,1712859184,103,0,30

The story mode is super surprising so far, this is not just hockey games, it feels more like a Beat 'Em Up with hockey elements. I love it.
For someone who is pretty tired of the yearly NHL games, this is very refreshing. It brings me back to my childhood playing NHL '94 where it was way more pick-and-play.

Very cool so far, there's nothing like this on Steam!

Also, I played the demo a while back and the game has improved a lot since. The devs are quite active on Discord.",1,1712854494,111,0,15
2702,1484180,"The game started off well and I played through the entire story in order to unlock all the playable characters for online play. This took me approximately 3-3.5 hours to complete. Online play seemed fun and I played a few matches the first night and signed off enjoying the game.

Day 2 of play rolled around and 2 of my friends had bought the game as my current impression of the game and their prior interest equated to all 3 of us playing. They played through as little of the tutorial/story as possible to get to online matchmaking which for them, was less than an hour.

We quickly discovered that this game is going to have a meta that makes it absolutely awful to play online, which ultimately, is the entire long term focus of the game. You are able to wind up a slap shot from anywhere on the ice regardless of whether or not you have the puck. Once you're fully wound up, a team mate can pass to you and it will automatically initiate the slo-mo shot sequence which almost always results in a goal. Basically an opposing player can cherry pick, wind up and receive a full ice pass, then score on repeat. It's very difficult to defend because the camera always follows the puck and not your player so even if you hang back to defend against it, you can't guarantee that you're close enough to the opposing player to prevent this. 

This needs to be changed by either making slapshots only able to be powered up while holding the puck, making it so that it's not always a guaranteed goal if you do this from outside the offensive zone (you can currently score from your own end doing this), or make it so that each players camera follows their own player and not the puck. My friends were able to get refunds but I was not due to 2+ hours of gameplay.

I cannot recommend this game in it's current state but it's definitely fixable and hopefully they change for the better to fix this issue.",0,1713467117,308,0,1

Pros -
- If you don't care about the below, buy this game it's super fun and plays fantastic. Everything else is great.

Cons - 
- Server Browser Matchmaking -- really no way to jump into a match and play right away. You have to suffer through trying to get in a server with randoms
- No tournament or cup play -- doesn't have that all familiar cup grind from the Super Mario Strikers games
- No dekeing or stick control -- kinda limits what you can do and makes it kinda repetitive to score

2732,1484231,"I left twenty five pages of constructive feedback, based both on industry and personal experience, and was banned from the Steam forums and League of Maidens Game Hub for it.

No proper reason was given, and there was no communication.

Two days later in their Discord, after others had showed support for my feedback, and disdain that it was not only deleted but also led to a forum ban, I was banned from the Discord server, without even reposting the feedback and without even saying anything against the devs, and any conversation around it was completely deleted.

No proper reason was given, and there was no communication.

While discussing what had happened with others I frequently spoke with in game, just trying to make sense of it, and letting people know what had happened, I was suddenly unable to send chat messages at all and I was effectively chat banned.

No proper reason was given, and there was no communication.

The lead developer for this game is exceedingly toxic. The hate he has for users' feedback is long and storied, and I didn't know that before submitting my own. There are tales of his ban waves during closed alpha, where he'd shut down random people and youtubers alike indiscriminately, all for ""criticizing"" his game. It didn't matter that my intent was purely to be helpful. It didn't matter that my feedback wasn't just ""this is bad"", but instead ""here is how you can improve this and ALSO get more money out of it"". None of that mattered to him. He took personal offense to ""criticism"" of his game and lashed out as much as he could in every avenue available to him.

The issues with the game are apparent. While the gameplay is good, everything on top of it needs a GREAT deal of work, from UX/UI, to how the game is monetized and player customization, to just how enemies try and fight you. It's barely even a framework right now.

But if players are being banned JUST for leaving feedback, there is no hope for the future of this game.

Try the game out, see if you like it. Why not, it's free. But don't spend a single dime on this product. The very second you speak up about something, expect to be struck down. It doesn't matter how much you spend on it as plenty can attest to now, how much you've supported the game with your words and actions prior.

The fact you spoke up is an ""unforgivable crime"" here.

However, I have seen and heard from many players that the price of this product for USA, UK and several EU countries is around 29.99$, this package is not at all worth such high price.

I'll start with the good stuff.  The artwork is great – lovely scenes and good character design as well.  There are lots of references to GoIO and it is nice to feel immersed while reading it.  

But that's where I have to get to the negatives.  The game (despite it's impressive word count)  doesn't feel like a complete experience, even if you explore the entire dialogue tree.
The actual length isn't even the issue as such.  Rather the issue I have is that the story doesn't really get very far by the time you are entirely through it.  The impressive word count is largely padding and by the time you reach the end of it, you've only really experienced plot-wise what feels like an opening act.  You met some characters, but the story has no resolution, no tying up of any ends.

From what I understand, the plan is to have the 6 DLCs – one for each faction with the related story.  That's all fine, but the base game neutral arc isn't a complete story at all.  And this lack of resolution is why I cannot recommend getting it in the current form.  
If you really enjoy GoIO, you will probably find some enjoyment here, but as an actual story, the plot is just too incomplete.",0,1645011518,859,0,15

2810,1483300,"[i] [h1] Rarely can a book or a game leave a mark on your soul and help you realise something new...  [/h1] 
To be honest, I am not familiar with the original book of the French writer Gaston Leroux. But I hope that one day I will read this legendary book. In the meantime, I am writing a review based on what I know about this interesting story. I've loved the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and the 2004 film adaptation since I was a kid. I fell in love with a romantic story about a love triangle between a mysterious Angel of Music and an ordinary chorus girl from Sweden named Christine Daaé. I can't count how many times I reviewed this film and I was genuinely surprised how my opinion and attitude to the choice of the main character changes with age. 
But today we are talking about a game based on this wonderful story. I did not expect anything serious and high-quality, from a small Korean studio that makes simple games for mobile phones. To tell you the truth, I didn't know anything about them until I came across this project. I am no longer a child, and I still liked this project. Despite the cute cartoon graphics and the complete lack of voice acting (for the full immersion in the game, I would like to hear the wonderful voices of the characters, but I understand that to demand this from a game that was originally developed for mobile phones is dumb) you still genuinely care about the characters and Eric even looks creepy.

And now directly to the analysis of this game. In comparison with the legendary film, I want to note that this story is less romantic, it reveals the characters' character and PTSD much better, with the accompanying bouquet of Eric's mental illnesses. There is no clear division between ""bad"" and ""good"", there is no boundary between ""good"" and ""evil"". You understand that people are not born evil or good, their character is formed exclusively from their experiences and moral views. This makes the characters feel alive and real. The story is disturbing, dark, and sentimental. But not as sentimental as in the movie. The image of Eric in the movie is really too romanticised. Maybe this is due to a lack of screen time. In the span of 3 hours, it is impossible to solve this story from the point of view of psychology. As a musical, the film is simply amazing. But this game reveals and shows what the film could not show. [b] Humanity, acceptance, and hopelessness.  [/b] The importance of making the right choice and how complex the relationships between people are. For me, a lot of things became a discovery, I recognised myself in the characters and constantly rethought my behaviour in certain situations. This project shows that many people get lost, thinking that society does not accept them for some reason beyond their control, and begin to hate and despise it and themselves. But in fact, [b] the only thing that affects people's attitude towards you is your personality. Your words, choices, and actions.  [/b] This game helped me to look at the world around me in a different way and I am immensely grateful for this. I recommend this project to everyone, regardless of how old you are and whether you like the concept of the story about ""A Ghost living in the basements of the Paris Opera building"".

2812,1483300,"TLDR: This take on the 1910 novel of Phantom of the Opera gave me a ride that kept me coming back for more even if I did know the order of events. With a soundtrack that compliments the story progression this is by far one of the best visual novels I have played this year. Highly Recommend, I will keep an eye out for future projects from this team.


Growing up and in the later years of my public education I was incredibly enthralled with the world that was the Phantom of the Opera that I got to see the actual musical on Broadway, got the chance to play Music of the Night in my high school advanced orchestra (even memorizing and playing it at gigs) that it goes without saying, I had high expectations going into this. There was a lot for them to live up to given my obsession with it and what I got was everything I wanted and more. 

The game play is a simple and plain point and click adventure type of experience with a few ""mini-game"" sequences that appear throughout including pattern recognition sequences, a single run sequence that is easier than those in their previous game Jekyll & Hyde, and a few swipe in a direction sequences. Most of the story is told by interacting with specific individuals and finding footnotes that add to a ""diary"" of sorts that gives more background on events, characters, symbols, and a few other categories. These footnotes will generally show up naturally near the character with natural story progression with a few exceptions. 

While I truthfully, didn't use much of the background information footnotes or the summary of interactions between characters (cause I binged the game and all events were fresh in my memory) I did find the latter screen neat but cluttered. You had all the key figures to the story in a branched sequence and upon clicking them info about their relationship with other characters. What makes it cluttered is that when you get to the main characters like Raoul or Christine those notes are incredibly long due to all the interactions for them in the game. This however doesn't detract from the game as it's only there for the players benefit if they needed a quick refresher about something in a previous chapter. What could make this frustrating is that it's organized by character not chapter, but I find that to be a pickier note personally rather than a true hindrance to the game.

The interaction in turn with all the main characters was incredibly intriguing for me. Each of them felt alive and three dimensional rather than a caricature created off the most basic idea of the character they are meant to portray. The story explores difficult topics that we still see even today with the ostracizing of those who are different from what modern society deems ""normal"", and the effects it has on those individuals depending on their surroundings. Here the phantom is not romanticized, here the phantom is pitiable and the actions he takes are not ones easily, if ever, forgiven. Due to the actions the phantom takes against Christine in his warped pursuit of love, parallels are also drawn between the relationship between Christine and Raoul as well. It was this dynamic between the three main figures that despite knowing how everything ended that had me holding my breath waiting to see how different sequences would be handled. 

My favorite motif that I didn't even realize explicitly until the end was the prevalence of a black rose and roses in general. This simple addition added another layer to the complex relationship between the main cast and hinted to the ending to those unfamiliar with the story from the very beginning. Even if you already know what a black rose symbolizes it simply gives you a general idea of what kind of story you're in for, and no, it's overall not happy. This is ultimately a tragedy, that you start to unfold through a story as a detective in the beginning. You listen to people regal their tales of what happened and how it ultimately affected the lives of those involved. 

In the end this is easily one of the best visual novels period, I have ever played, but it's not perfect. Some may not like the more kinetic tone the novel takes with only a few minor choices making an impact. Despite the high regard I held the original works, this version entertains, offers an additional new ending instead of just the canon ending of the book, and most of all left me thinking of it long after I finished the story. If a story can manage to make me think about it days after I finished it, that's a story well told in my book.

2815,1483300,"The game itself is not bad, a few glitches here and there, subpar dialogue, and a few typos.. Game play is rather minimal and way too easy.

My biggest gripe as a extremely fond Phantom fan is the portrayal of Erik in this version. The developers turned him into a caricature of himself. Too over the top... And that's coming from a reader of the original novel where Erik is quite over the top.

As a visual novel it failed to capture the nuance of Erik as well as the the profound, but ambiguous connection Erik and Christine share. A sadly wasted opportunity. Its a real pity.

The way they used powerful, emotional lines from the novel also fell completely flat because of the way they re-contextualized them through the change to Erik's character and the relationship between Erik and Christine.

Even Raoul was more of a jerk than in the novel. Probably because of some misplaced need to teach young girls a lesson about relationships. Blegh. I saw it coming when I saw the warning page at the start of the page talking about triggers. It really undermines the reader/ players intelligence.

I've read plenty of fanfic a 100x better than this, some of which analysed the relationship between Erik and Christine in an unflinching, realistic light. And those were free.

If you're a Phantom fan, don't waste your money. It has nothing of the true heart of this story that makes it a classic loved and cherished by many.

If you're a casual who wants a classic horror visual novel... its all right I guess.

2816,1483300,"This game is way too underrated... 

First of all, forget about the movies, the game uses the original Book as for it's base, (with some extras ofc but it's not that influential) and i must say it did an amazing job! So well made, amazing details, and hooollysheep. It's so beautiful.

The game keeps it simple. Click to move, objects and mini games are easy, yet entertaining. Conversations are useful, and funny. Characters are well made, the music on point (I mean, i really would suggest to put it into the ""good music material"" ngl.) the athmosphere gets Spooky when it's necessary, but it can also be pretty chill to play. Also, if you missed an achievement, or a collectible ( you can literally see when starting the chapter how many you need to collect btw..) you can always replay the chapter.

Honestly, if ur such a POTO fan, then definitely give it a go! If you're not familiar with either the book, or the movies, worry not, it literally gives you a summ up about characters, and events, so you won't get lost either! :) 

I really wanted to write this rating because i almost missed an oportunity to play such a sweet, intense and spooky game cause of the lack of reviews / mixed ratings. Not to mention, POTO is one of my all time favorite books. C:

2817,1483300,"I never read or watched Phantom of the Opera; I came from a position of total newcomer. I'll review this as a game first and foremost. While I generally recommend it - the story is heart-wrenching, tense, and interesting all the way through - the game adaptation is... bad. The graphics are amazing, the pictures are wonderful, and there are moments where the writing (as in character dialogue) suddenly becomes stellar. The further in the game, the more of those moments are. But otherwise?

First of all, the pacing. Oh god, it's so slow. It feels like there are a lot of completely unnecessary scenes, a lot of ridiculously drawn out dialogue, padding in the form of sluggish and boring minigames, and sometimes just walking, walking, walking. I'm a very fast reader and it took me 18 hours overall to beat this, mostly because of the padding. It's absolutely terrible and the biggest strike against the game.

Second, the soundscape. It's very bad, but sometimes... it's good. Scenes often are padded with anime impact sounds, which most of the time are annoying, and sometimes just plain wrong. One character (Jammes) in particular tends to scream and run around in the most inappropriate situations, and nobody reacts. Does she not actually scream? Is it just for the player? Who knows. That said, the sounds related to the Phantom add some intensity and spice; lots of creepiness to go around. The Phantom's voice actor is pretty good as well - in fact, all characters' voice actors have a certain flair - but you don't hear the characters speak, merely grunt or laugh or sigh. But it fits; perhaps it's even great.

Third, the music. This game is a mobile port and it shows just how wide the chasm between what the expected quality is on mobile and on Steam is. Almost all music pieces loop after 10-15 seconds, oftentimes less. And this is a game about music, mind! Especially jarring are the moments when the characters sing on stage; you have some 6 second loop of an opera piece, where it just repeats. It's criminal. And the worst part? The music is actually pretty good. It's fitting, it sets the mood, it sounds good. But the looping problem makes it almost unbearable.

Fourth, the look. Nothing bad to say here; it's great. Characters are emotive, have lots of different portraits, expressions; it's incredibly tense to see a certain character slowly reveal their darker and darker side, until they almost become completely unhinged - and for the rest of the story, you'll always remember those insane eyes. The look is probably the best part of the game. And the character designs are lovely as well; everyone is unique and very fitting to their role. 

And finally, the story. Apart from the pacing problems and writing hiccups, it's fantastic. But that's Gaston Leroux’s story, so props to him. Like I wrote before: it's tense, it's intriguing, and it's heartbreaking. I can see why this is a literary classic.

Overall - I'd like to not recommend this game, but I can't, simply because it showed me the wonderful story of the Phantom of the Opera. I'd say go read the book instead, but the game... well, like I said, it's bad, but it's also got wonderful moments. Can you handle the bad to get to the good? Up to you. Hope that helps!",1,1654114057,1103,0,357

2823,1483300,"I am a shameless Phangirl and Erik!Simp, and I've noticed several other Phans have given this game negative reviews, but I will actually defend this game as a worthy addition to different interpretationsf of Gaston Leroux's classic novel. I have read the original novel in two different translations, and have a third on my shelf I've been meaning to read. I have seen the Musical!Movie and have a DVD of the Royal Theater adaption.

I have read many Phantom retellings and many are unique takes. Including Susan Kay's. And I feel that this interpretation is just as valid as others.

First, of all I feel just how human this game is. Yes, Erik is extra level evil in this, while in the original novel he does make the right decision in the end, and redeems himself, this version takes any sympathy you could possibly have for him and chunks it out the window. And I can understand why many Phans hate this. But in the end, I actually say...isn't this in many ways more realistic? I have sadly meet several 'Eriks' in my life, and most of them had this ending instead of a last second redemption. So, to see such a sad, and pitiful version evoked a lot of emotion out of me.

It actually really fits a gothic tragedy in a way that Erik's fate was handled here. While, I can't phangirl over this one, I can appreciate the sheer humanity of the character here because in many ways this is what would happen in reality from my own understanding and experience with human nature.

I actually liked this Christine, and her growing a backbone and becoming a stronger and layered character instead of what most adaptions do. Her growth is amazing, and I loved it. I also enjoyed Raoul's redemption as well. I liked the dept that was given to the side characters especially the Persian who is left out of more adaptions. 

I just feel a lot of phans are being too hard on this game. It isn't as romantic as most modern versions are by any means, but at the same time the original novel wasn't meant to be a romance. Leroux never intended a gothic romantic classic. He just wanted a detective story that Hollywood and Broadway decided was actually an epic love story and changed it.

So, as a diehard Phan/Eric!Simp, I approve!",1,1716688220,1275,0,42
2824,1483300,"Since it is the second game that I have played from this franchise (the first one was the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde), I like this game as well, the characters, the overall story, once again the art style and the soundtrack is as awesome as ever. I have only two things that I wish there were on this game. A)I wish I could play as the Phantom of the Opera, sure you can play as the evil managers but it isnt the same. If we look on the previous game Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde you had the opportunity to play as Mr. Hyde, sadly in the Phantom of the Opera you cannot play as him. B)Some parts of the story was a little big cringy (Im referring to the scenes with Jammes, I know that she tries to be kawaii but lets be real, I it is kinda annoying.) So I dont really think that these sort of scenes were necessary. Yet again Im not the creator of the game (I must say however that the developers did a magnificent job with the game) and also I still like this game nonetheless. If you love gothic novels and If you love Mazm games then I highly recommend this game.

P.S. Although the Phantom of the Opera/Erik/Angel of music is my favourite character and Villain, my favourite game will always be Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde. So in my opinion The phantom of the opera is my second favourite game. Hopefully in the future  there will be more novel adaptations such as Dracula or the Invisible man or even Dorian Gray.

Another P.S. Although I feel a bit disgusted when it comes to cliche endings in general, I prefer the first ending which is that the couple (Raoul and Christine are together)",1,1715449718,1535,0,35
2825,1483300,"On one hand, it is very gorgeous. The character portraits are beautiful, the scenes are well designed, and the interface is pretty. The Phantom himself is frankly the best Leroux designed Phantom I'd ever seen outside of Lon Chaney's. The face is 11/10. Even the incidental characters (little Jammes for instance) are nice to look at. 

On the other hand, the mobile phone interface that the game originally ran with is a big hindrance on the computer. I really do not want to click and wait on the characters to move slowly to their spots. I wish there was some sort of keyboard interface where it wasn't constant clicking to get the characters where you need to go to. The collectibles are in places you have no reason to go into, so you're walking around slow as molasses to pick up a tidbit of information like ""The Opera Ganier opened in 1875."" And then although the little chibi versions of the character do have their cuteness, you start to get annoyed looking at them move their way slowly to where they need to go, or to do a limited animation loop before you get the next dialogue option. It also doesn't help to accommodate its free to play mobile phone version, that the game is sectioned into a bunch of episodes which run even slower than a soap opera (I'm in the middle of rewatching one, so the comparison is fresh). 

Lastly, the story they take odd liberties with the source material. I haven't seen the extent of the liberties since I haven't completed it (sentiment from the community from what I've heard is not good), but I am aware that they made the Phantom pretty despicable in this. This isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me (if you recognize the icon, you can see potentially why), but all they really had to do was tell the Leroux story accurately and this game would've been praised to high heaven and back by Phans. It just seems so weird to take a perfectly acceptable narrative and then alter it to make it less good for no inherent reason. Its one thing to dial the romance up or the violence up, but I'm not sure who was asking for this change in the narrative. Nobody particularly wants Christine to girlboss into the sun, or Raoul to be a jerk, or the Phantom to be irredeemable. We just want the original narrative, if possible, or at least an acceptable alternative (give us a good romance, a good slasher, heck, anything). 

Overall, I think the game would be better if they had released this as a purely menu based visual novel. The portraits are good, they'd only need to make a few for non-essential NPCs, cut out a lot of the random plot elements (like the strike), tidy up the narrative, and return it more closely to Leroux and you'd have the perfect game. You could even have two plots, one that sticks as closely to the novel as it can, and a 'redux' version that is for, I dunno, modern sensibilities? I really don't know what they were going for. As it is however, even as a big Phan and a person who plays visual novels, I can't recommend it. I just can't. I'm trying to complete it purely for completion's sake, but it might be just easier to watch Dario Argento's Phantom of the Opera film 5x in a row than finish this.",0,1714098627,260,0,22

---

I've been a fan of the story of Phantom of the Opera for many years now, first having listened to the musical on CD's back in my early teens, to reading the original novel (and various fanfictions) to watching the 2004 movie and seeing the Broadway production live a couple of times. This visual novel adaptation is pretty strictly a take on the original novel. I'll try to break down what I liked, what I didn't like, and in between for this game.

The Positives:
- Firstly is the art style. Of course when we're talking about a visual novel, the art is perhaps the most important part of the entire thing. Without good art, it's hard to hook in players, even with good writing, characterization and the like. From the cute sprites, to the character portraits and then the gorgeous digital paintings you unlock as you progress throughout the story, it's all phenomenal. A particular shout out to the design of Erik, the titular Phantom of the Opera; his masked and particularly unmasked designs are incredible (the unhinged expression is truly menacing, I love it), and probably my favorite take of him I have seen yet (especially given that they did not back down on giving him a horrific looking deformity, as some adaptations have been known to tone it down, for practical reasons or not).
- The atmosphere of the game is stellar, truly gives one the feeling of an intense mystery unfolding with some gothic horror elements. There are moments of comedy, which are a nice break from some of the intensity of the more thrilling parts of the story. Even with knowing how the story ends, what happens next, they did a good job nailing the feeling of the original story (except for one thing but I will get to that).
- The musical elements, while sometimes a bit repetitive, were also great. Actually using operatic aria's for key moments was great. I wish there were more times of getting to hear Erik sing, but perhaps it's for the best they kept it to a minimum; they still got it across well that he has an amazing voice.
- Keeping in a number of the details from the original novel. What I mean is like, things like the ""safety pin"" incident, or the ""siren"" of the lake (and how that is accomplished). Little bits and pieces that are often looked over in adaptations and fanfics but were included here, is certainly a welcome addition.
- The little footnotes and collectibles you get throughout the game are neat. They range from true facts based around bits and pieces of the world the story is set (society, fun history facts and more) to little details of the characters (even if they're expanded upon and not from the original book). I enjoyed collecting and reading them. They help shape the world better and give more of an idea of what life is like when the story takes place. Something that would have been obvious when the novel was first published but will be lost on many readers today (unless they're history buffs too).
- The adapted characterization of a number of the characters, particularly the dancers, Carlotta and a bit of Raoul and Christine. I enjoyed that Christine actually has some friends within the opera house here, which is sorely lacking in the original story. We don't get to see it really, but it's stated that Christine and Carlotta were good friends before some drama ensued. They gave Raoul some better character growth that isn't seen really in much of any other adaptation, nor even the original novel. I also like that Christine keeps the backbone she has in the original novel. Too often she's reduced to a damsel in distress when she actually manages to save herself and everyone around her. But, that does get me to some of negatives of this game...

The Negatives:
- The other half of the narrative changes, and this unfortunately mostly revolves around Erik. It's no secret that he is far from a positive character. The original novel acknowledges that his deformity isn't the true source of all his suffering, but that it's the closed minds of people and the society that made him the way he is. The game acknowledges this, kind of, but I felt fairly missed the mark. The whole point of the original story is that it's a tale of mystery, tragedy but also redemption. Erik finally finds salvation and humanity when Christine actually shows him true compassion in the end and, realizing his faults, he ultimately lets her and Raoul go. This doesn't happen in the game. Instead, they choose to make Erik... fairly irredeemable. Not completely unsympathetic but boy do they try. I feel like wholly demonizing Erik takes away from the story and it loses a great deal of its value. It feels like the developers also missed the tragedy of who Erik is, and why he is the way he is (which is funny because they do in part acknowledge this matter), even though I do understand what they were trying to say in framing him the way they did (in that no matter how terrible someone's life is, you do not owe them anything, especially if they have abused you. This is a fine point to make, but, that isn't necessarily what the story of Phantom of the Opera is truly about.) This leads me to...
- This is a bit of a spoiler just for this game only, you have been warned. [spoiler]Completely new to this game and only in this game/adaptation, there is a woman named Melek, who is really solely in the game just to showcase how ""terrible"" Erik is. She is a blind maid from Turkey, whom Erik kidnaps after she had rejected a marriage proposal from him. Imo, it detracts Christine's role in the story, and Erik's character. She likely was also added in for some padding for the game, but really, she shouldn't have ever been included. Which is a shame, cause she isn't terrible character, just unnecessary for the story.[/spoiler]
- There are some sound bits that can get... a little annoying at times, the main one being Jammes ""terrified"" scream that she does... way too often, even when not terrified. It's not nearly as big of a detractor as the first two points, but it certainly pulled me out of the experience when it would happen. It was fine the first couple of times, but got old soon afterwards.

The Mixed: 
- There were points the game would... kind of glitch. Such as after having a character make a selection, it will have the character portrait pop up with the text of the ""selection"" you choose crop up briefly. This didn't bother me too much but it is noticeable. Perhaps the most damning example happens late in the game. [spoiler]After when Raoul washes up on the shores of the lake, having escaped the torture chamber and Erik believes he is dead, for whatever reason the game uses Christine's portrait in place of Raoul's, even though he is still the one speaking. I haven't gone to check if this always happens or it was just a one time thing but, it was quite goofy.[/spoiler]
- While the art is amazing, I was disappointed with the lack of various costumes and the like for the characters. I understand it's a lot of work to do, but I can't help but be disappointed that hardly anything was done for the Masquerade scene. Not even giving Erik the infamous Red Death costume? A true shame. Still, it didn't bum me out enough to really list it as a ""negative"".

Overall:
This is probably one of the better adaptations of the Phantom of the Opera story there is, even with the various narrative changes that I don't always wholly agree with or like (granted, that IS what fanfic is for. (; ). If you're at all a fan of Phantom of the Opera, or hell, just want a neat, engaging visual novel to play, absolutely give this a shot. It's certainly well worth the time.",1,1641176928,1988,0,4

2831,1483320,"Edit: Game has had substantial updates and patches so I have rewritten this review. The old review is spoliered out at the bottom.

A fun little model train driving game that is definitely worth $10. The campaign consists of a bunch of missions that range from limited resource management to just driving deliveries. The puzzle piece placement of the tracks is simple and fun. Driving the trains is fun too (except when trying to get up the comically steep hills).

My biggest gripe is the lack of train automation. Some of the later missions and the freeplay mode will require the player to micromanage quite a few trains at the same time to meet the demands of industries and settlements. There is time pressure to most of the missions and modes since settlements not supplied with their needs will become unhappy and start losing their population. If their population gets too low, the settlement's production will slow down or stop altogether. If you have trouble with multitasking, you may find the game quite difficult or overwhelming at some parts. Something even as simple as a flag dropped on the tracks that stops the first train that hits it would be huge, although I'd like the ability to control trains remotely with a remote similar to the ones some modern model trains have.

If you don't have issues with multitasking, I would definitely recommend this game.


Old review:
[spoiler]Overall on the fence about this one. I had some fun but there are a lot of bugs and QoL issues that are preventing me from giving it a thumbs up. It definitely needs some work to be worth $10.

First off, I tried to load an autosave after wrecking a train for the first time. Couldn't figure out which one it was of the 20+ saves that were already in there, despite never saving the game. Turns out none of them were mine and I guess they were test maps left in by the dev (oops). I wiped them all so I know which ones are mine. The 'load the autosave' is actually the button right under load in the load menu and there is only one that overwrites quite frequently. Unfortunately I later lost a whole hour to the frequent autosaves when it saved while I accidentally crashed a train and needed to restart the mission. There really need to be 2 or more that can be loaded instead of just the 1.

Lots of building bugs too. [strike]I managed to fill the entire tutorial city with phantom houses. Turns out the placement guides don't go away when you select another house type[/strike] (Fixed). Resources are also removed if you delete the extractor building over them, so be sure of how you place them or be prepared to restart. Also saw some buffers left behind after deleting track, but I was able to work around it easy enough.

Multiple locos in a single train are buggy too. All locos in a train consume fuel when you are driving but only the one under direct control provides power. You have to jump into one, put it in cruise control, and then jump into the other in order to make it up hills without a large running start. 2 electric engines are really OP on trains because putting either one into cruise control and backing out of drive mode lets the one not in cruise recharge. You can abuse this to have them run forever by just swapping which engine is in cruise.

I could go on about how electric locos are OP and some other strange balancing choices, but I'd flip my review if the old saves were cleaned, there was more than 1 autosave slot, [strike]the housing placement got cleaned up [/strike] (Fixed), resources were not removed when deleting extraction buildings, and multi loco trains actually operated as a single unit.

[strike]And a horn/whistle button is added for driving. The lack of one is unforgivable[/strike] (Added).[/spoiler]",1,1684641355,3017,0,19

The fun is in the sandbox where you set up your own freight yards and move product around. It's different then a game like Transport Fever where you set up the route and the game engine runs all the trains.
In Railroad Engineer, you have to drive your own train.

There are a few things I'd change but the developer is on top of all of the shortcomings. Honestly, you never know what the public is going to want until you publish the game. And you can't really iron out all of the possible bugs until its's played, so I'm hopeful the little things will be taken care of.

Dice Rollers also quite accurately portrays the tabletop gaming experience (I've certainly known a player like Maki before...) and manages to tell an interesting story both within and outside the D&D-like game that the characters are playing. I admit I wish there was a bit more focus on romance, but I did manage to get the ending with the girl I liked, Akane, so I'm happy! ^_^",1,1682519589,227,0,58
2858,1483370,"With the game now having a fully playable route and two distinct endings, I think it's about time to share some thoughts on it.

When it comes to RPG combat, I tend to be somebody who dislikes minigames or button prompts. I'm a fan of pressing a button and having damage done. The Use of Life is built around button prompts, but they're entirely reaction based and as a response to the enemy, rather than something you do for the benefit of your own attacks. I really enjoy this, it means that if you're skillful you're able to go the whole game without taking any damage. For Misha route I primarily used the Robes of Death that kept me at near oneshot territory, making it feel very rewarding to be able to clear encounters without having to use any retries.

In terms of classes, every path seems to be fairly unique, although what little I played of magic it seemed to be the weakest link. Despite having invested a lot into int and sorcery in order to use curseblade, I found myself using my HP as a resource more than I did mana due to built in class features making it easier to manage that.

The game's choices seem to carry weight and I enjoy the number rolling. It's very easy to elicit emotions just from the RNG of rolling low on something you very well should have succeeded at or clutching out something you definitely could have failed. Dialogue options remained somewhat relevant later on, though don't expect a narrative that constantly shifts based on your choices. There are consequences but overall the main branches are very easy to spot.

The writing isn't anything special, but it gets the job done. Characters have clear personalities and are all around enjoyable, though this is only really my experience in the Misha route as I'm waiting for more content to be added to the other playthrough before giving it a shot. Everybody has great designs (especially Goshe, whole reason I gave this game a shot was because of how much I love his aesthetic) and it's overall an enjoyable story.

I really like this game and think it has a lot of potential, and with two endings implemented I think it's a decent enough time to give it a shot if you're interested. I think the game could use some work in terms of combat variety and balance, but it's still early access and I've seen enough changes since I first started playing last year that I'm sure the dev will do their best.",1,1716499156,617,0,5
2859,1483370,"This is the kind of game you try out and end up spending the entire remaining day playing. I don't know how novel the mechanics in this game are since I don't play many similar games but it felt very novel, refreshing and well thought out. 

Game doesn't just rely on figuring out optimal character builds but also on your own skill. Reaction time, memorizing attack dodge patterns, weighing up defense vs offense etc. It all feels very skill dependent with both many decisions as well as mechanical execution, even the random encounter slots-style rolls which are realistically too fast to react to still feel as if you are controlling the outcome.

The story is simple but endeering, I very much enjoy these kinds of linear branching RPGs, with 4 endings (2 available as of now) and 4 build paths there is quite a bit of replayability too.",1,1719775803,1650,0,3

Hate this crap.  Was trying to support a developer that has apparently let this happen to multiple supporters.  Bad move man.  Pretty shady.  Refund or content.  I want 400 gems as promised.

I was able to resolve this issue with this per the developer on other negative reviews:

* Update to the latest version of the game
* Make sure Steam overlay is enabled
* In the Steam Library, select Leaf Blower Revolution -> Manage DLC -> Enable all checkboxes -> Scroll down -> Click save
* Click on Restore DLC Purchases in the DLC Shop ingame

No credit given for this.  I've never had a problem with something I pay for working right off on Steam.  NEVER.  Several others have had problems with this purchase.

A nice, short, and cheap arcade-y skiing game where you simply need to make it to the end of 60 levels filled with hazards, enemies, and even a yeti. You'll also need to weave between slalom flags and sometimes worry about a timer. The controls are tight and the sprite artwork looks pretty nice. It took me almost exactly 100 minutes to beat every level.

It obviously looks similar to SkiFree, the developer themselves said it was an inspiration, but other than it being a game where you ski downward while avoiding hazards (and seldomly a yeti), there isn't much else in common. While SkiFree was an endless game where you just try to survive as long as you can, in Death Ski it's entirely level-based (each level is roughly 1-2 minutes long), and there's a plot involved. It's not a particularly in-depth plot, but I enjoyed it.

I only have three complaints with the game:

[olist]
    [*]There's nothing to do once you beat all 60 levels. No achievements to go toward, no extra modes, nothing. An endless mode with a randomized mountain would've been perfect!

    [*]The ""wind"" hazard was incredibly annoying, it was often placed in spots where I needed to go toward the wind to get to a slalom flag and if I didn't get lucky with timing in-between the gusts of wind, I was screwed and would miss the flag and/or get thrown against a spike trap and have to restart. The game would've been better off without this hazard, in my opinion.

    [*]I had a bug on levels 43 and 48 where the NPC you race (Knightley) never showed up at the finish line so I was stuck looking at ""Level Complete!"", unable to continue. I had to pause and quit to the menu and do those levels again.
[/olist]

Other than that, I really enjoyed Death Ski. I'd love to see more of it with either updates, DLC, or a sequel. I got it for a measly $0.79 in the current Steam sale and it was well worth the price!",1,1666693471,100,0,165
2984,1483580,"Great old school skiing game. You have have 60 challenges including slaloms, outrunning avalanches, snowballs, obstacles. etc. There are 20 challenges for each of the 3 levels. The developer made the game at just the right difficulty, as I usually ended up with 1 second left on each of the challenges. It took me an hour to finish the first level.

[i] I would like to disclose that I had access to the game before early access. [/i]
Nurose removes the usual constraints of weapons and spells in other games and leaves it up to the user's imagination. Using the spell building system alone allows you to make infinite number of possible spells that suit your own specific playstyle. Don't like the ranged spammers? Build a spell to speed yourself up and close the distance or make a wall-like spell to block incoming projectiles, it's up to you! 
In addition to that, Nurose offers multiple types of elements that can change up how you interact with your spells, adding another layer of depth. It may take some time tinkering with the spell system at first but the playground allows for any type of innovation to take place.
Overall the game offers a great amount of freedom and therefore fun in an arena-style game that I haven't experienced before. Add onto that a motivated developer, I can't wait to see what types of glyphs and elements future updates may bring.

3002,1482640,"The graph editor leaves a lot to be desired, much like Gladiabots', except it's worse. I'm not sure if it's supposed to suck as a way to balance spellcrafting but I often find myself wishing I could rotate blocks, or place bridge tiles. Inputs and outputs overlap constantly, forcing you to use the unwieldy arrow blocks. It just doesn't feel good. It's like it can't decide whether it wants to be a puzzle game or an open-ended spell programming engine.

There are not that many nodes, and even if they can be combined very creatively, they get stale quick. The control flow nodes are godawful. Since you can't reuse nodes you end up with a lot of duplicated conditions. Loops are messy, especially if you run multiple at the same time. Condition nodes are awful both because the layout for them sucks, and because you can't use them inside loops.

I don't really vibe with the classes, either. They are pretty samey, and the water and life classes are based around spawning pickups which is meh as a mechanic.

While you can come up with some pretty strong combos in spite of all of this, a majority of the time the game will clip your wings quite harshly with arbitrary limitations. It just doesn't let you build anything too crazy, which, while good on paper, is directly against the appeal of the game. Take Noita as an example of the opposite: it will gladly let you build an OP wand, but the drawback is that you'll most likely kill yourself with it.

The single player is literally just a test room with a few training dummies. There's no campaign, no interactive tutorial... And what little documentation there is, it's scarce.
Online is dead and the peak is 15 concurrent players so only grab this on sale and if you have friends to play with. Asymmetric online against other players' bots would be a massive improvement.

This doesn't have to be changed what-so-ever, i just have the thoughts of things like these every now and again when i play this game.

3004,1482640,"Even in this early stage, you can still really see the vision that the developer has for this game.

When you want to make an ability, tou get to pick between an element for a loadout of up to 4 spells, then for each spell you get to pick a different wand which can drastically change how a spell with work, then within that wand you can program a spell to do almost any variety of things, from functioning as a battery to just being an annoying wall for an opponent.

So this game currently appears to only offer 1 v 1 matchmaking or you can host a private game.  Without another player you are just in a small spade with the spells to tinker with and 3 target dummies.  NO AI or bots to play against.  I wont thumbs down because like the premise and the spell system , or I think I do not having actually been able to see what the actual game play is like vs opponents.  But I sat in queue for an hour and nothing happened.  Yes it is 1 am EST on a Sunday but basically I cant actually play the game.  So please understand what you are getting into.

3073,1482670,"NOTE:  ** This review is the games first review here on Steam **

Nice trailer dev(s)...  But it doesn't fool me, especially when I get into your game.  The game 100% feels like a very low effort asset flip.  ..And though I haven't found the kit they used yet, it doesn't even matter.  The game feels bare bones and like it is lacking.  It's not fun, regardless of whether it's an asset flip like I feel it is or not.

The fact this game has all this hype on the store page, yet you can't even exit the game by hitting the ESC is very telling.  Asset flips are common for requiring you to ALT-F4 just to quit.  Asset flips are common for feeling lack luster and like a bare bones foundation of a game..

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgZhrROzCso

Developers love to use ""early access"" and promises in early access to try and sell off a low effort asset flip..  and I believe that's what it going on here with this game.  Like I said above though, it really doesn't matter because regardless, it's just not fun and it feels very incomplete.

NOT RECOMMENDED.  My advice is to wait the two or three months the developers say this game needs to leave early access and see if they actually complete the game to give it much more than it offers now.  I highly doubt much will change however.

My Score:  1 out of 10.  ..If I buy a box of cereal, it doesn't matter how good the box looks if inside the box..there's only two flakes of cereal and 99% air.  Same thing with this ""game"".",0,1613984173,20,0,1272
3074,1482680,"So I was really curious about this game, sadly the developer got a little excited and released this game way too early.

The game has no enemies, no options menu, no way to exit the game or instructions.
Once you chop down some trees that fall and then spaz out due to some crazy physics all you can do is access a build menu that let's you create some walls, steps, floor, door, base and I couldn't use the floor as a ceiling like it suggested.

The game has at least a 30 minute night cycle making it almost impossible to do anything, much less see. 
There is a flashlight in the house in the woods, but I can't figure out how to use it even after spamming every button on the keyboard.

The wall to the house in the woods on the backside is glitched so be careful because it's only invisible one way, you will get stuck in it.

There are 2 vehicles outside the train building (closed warehouse) and I couldn't figure out how to use it till about an 20 minutes later. Most objects in the game can be flung by dragging and releasing them resulting in super human strength and the ability to chuck a vehicle with your hand, mildly entertaining till it's not.

You can take the car and drive down each end of the road (1 road) the side closest to spawn takes you to the edge of the map where there is nothing. You can keep driving at what feels like 500 miles per hour till you hit a map border that you slam into.

If you can make it back to the road you left, and head in the opposite direction and follow the railroad track you'll find a winding road that goes again to no where.

At the end of the rail road track is a part of a train that seems to run on it's own for a short distance. You can't operate it so that's a shame.

There's food in the game but no way to eat it.

There's nothing to kill.

So there really isn't a whole lot to comment on. This seems like a tech demo or a project someone is playing around with.
I couldn't honestly suggest someone buy this game even at the low price and state that it's in. 

To be honest it's priced way too high.

There's a few other level design issues, and other things but I've said enough for now.
I hope the developer keeps working on the project and maybe some day it will be more than a testing ground for ideas.

I did snoop around the files of the game and noticed that the game has config files for VR even though it's not listed. I considered trying to boot up in my Rift S but honestly, at this point I was sick of playing around in it - maybe later.

I recorded a video in the attempt to upload it to youtube, but I'm not sure if I'm going to yet. Not much to show.

TLDR: Expensive tech demo with not much of anything to do, that costs way too much.

Atomic Guardians has tons of different enemy types, power-ups, and even multiple different ways to play. The bosses are easy to recognize, and each come with their own set of challenges! 

The entire game can be played with friends which adds tons of replay value, whether you are on the couch, or using steam remote-play.

3155,1482800,"So far, I'd recommend this. If you know Japanese well enough. A machine translation being worth it or not, I can't comment on. The story might get a little lost in translation. The gameplay is very easy to follow and should be much less problematic, especially because the game makes it very easy to see where to go, and what to make.

The protagonist is an alchemist, who comes to a tiny village in search of a new cauldron, as her old one unfortunately broke. She is accompanied by someone, kind of part of her family, that helps her out. While at first not very much welcomed, and the village seems to be not quite what she imagined, it turns out there actually is a cauldron around. Though the villagers considered it a.. bath tub. Oh well. With this cauldron she's able to help the villagers out with their troubles, to slowly become more trusted. All the while new characters come to this really tiny villain, and about everything and everyone seems to have a secret behind it. The village itself, as the villagers don't make it a secret that they HAVE a secret, our main alchemy girl herself getting assaulted by a weird flashy lightning similar to when her previous cauldron broke, and new traveler that seem to know a bit too much about their handiwork for just being a random traveler. 
The story manages to make your curious well enough, and it's easy too root for MC, as she lives by ""better do something instead of waiting around"" and likes to encourage a young girl in the village as well, to be more self confident and honest about your interests. Nothing wrong with that, sometimes a girl has to grow past all the protective guys around. And they really ARE protective. Overly so.


Now about the gameplay. This is actually surprisingly fun. Alchemy in this game works a bit like chemistry. Everything consists out of certain elements, to certain percentages. MCs helper is able to analyze the structure of things, so she can eventually create it with that help. However it's only basic material, nothing else. So to actually get use out of it, you need other people, like from the village. Like this you can create weapons, armor, usable items for healing or attacking, tools for gathering and so on. You can memo anything you want to create as well as how much, and your alchemy creation menu will nicely list all of the things you need to make. As you then let these people create it, the memo automatically adapts. It's a great comfort function.

So where to get material for alchemy? Obviously by going into dungeons. They are ""map"" based, with several nodes on, that linearly progress till it branches here and there. Every node has an encounter or a gathering field on it. Most encounter nodes you only have to do once, though can repeat if you want to, some limited ones however have to be done once per dungeon dive if you want to pass them. Usually so you have to fight once before being able to gather, as gathering fields also respawn when you re-enter a dungeon.
Battles are in a simple 2 row based battle system of up to 3 vs. 3. Once you have more members, you deploy them at the beginning of a battle. There's a lot of typical stuff around, but also some interesting gimmicks. Like you can shove enemies around (they can do that with you as well), you may ""summon"" objects onto the enemy field, like something that draws attacks, or a bomb that explodes after 2 turns or taking enough damage. Likewise a magic girl can create a catalyst before or after her, that amplifies her spell dramatically as long as it exists, though every spell cast lower HP of the catalyst by 30%. There are also interesting attacks that grow in power depending on how many enemies there are. Like higher status triggering chance, single target damage, or a hit all attack that has bad accuracy unless there are a lot of enemies. Objects you place on the enemy field also count there (!).
This is all even more fun, when you realize that enemies have conditional drops, as you may know from Etrian. One is generally a high chance, though can be made guaranteed when killed with a specific ability. Two are conditional, stuff like beating the enemy with a specific elemental attack, or on a specific row (remember showing enemies?). The drops all stack, so you can get all 3 at once. After beating any enemy 3 times, you also get told these conditions, even if you didn't get them yet. Only being able to equip up to 6 skills on each character also means, you have some customizing to do. That includes stuff like using items. Yes, not everyone can do that.


It.. works. There's plenty to play around with, to not get bored, and the story being somewhat mysterious and interesting is also nice. Plenty of comfort functions, auto save on returning to the village, save anywhere (outside of combat) and easy to use menus help. Sidequests reward you with actual combat skills for your characters and are as such super worth it, and it's just generally.. fun? Seems to be fairly decently long as well. My highest damage of a buffed up spell on a weakness was barely above 200 damage after 5 hours. There's an achievement for 30000 damage. Curious how that's going to end up.",1,1621795342,1428,0,52
3156,1482800,"Faraway Qualia, it is quite a deep and immersive game. I'll break it down by categories.

Story:

Coming upon a struggling village, Anisia aims to find out about the lost history of Meltria. Now, while the premise might seem basic, the story is very deep. From a character, who had to bear witness to the demise of someone important to him. Having to make up a lie, so Anisia thinking her master died in an accident. A boy who is the main's analyst, someone who is like a half to alchemists. An alchemist have the ability to create the world, and an analyst has the ability to identify the make up of qualia, both work hand in hand.

And he as well have a good story to him. Someone who is distant, but trusts Anisia. He doesn't speak much, and has a hatred for alchemists except for her. This stemming from his own family problem. 

Then there are other characters of the party, a chemist who has a difficult time trusting. She meets a person who wants to be a hero, someone more happy-go-lucky. Though, even he has a terrible past. All of these characters wonderfully build on each other, and the story has a somber but hopeful feel. The further I go, the more I want to see. It just has a very good progression.

Anisia is more kind spoken, and she can be a bit reckless. However, she learns from her mistakes, and can empathize with others. Her dream is to fulfill the type of alchemy her master believed in. And she knows that everyone has a different meaning on what makes them happy. She does not try to take on the burden of everyone, but helps those she can within her own power to do so. She does this while respecting them, and not imposing her happiness on them. Despite this, she does carry a deep pain in her. And at times it can leave her uncertain, but this is the thing. The characters all work great with each other, supporting and building on one another. It makes those somber scenes quite nice, and seeing how the past is. 

Just every end, this story was amazingly done. As it goes along, all the story lines connects, and have a center point that links everyone together.

Side Quests:

Side Quests allows you to learn skills, but also gives you more insight into other characters.

Character Scenes:

In between the main story, in the village you can find out more about the characters by speaking to them.

Art:

Wonderful art in the game, these works well with the scenes.

Music:

The main theme for scenes is more somber, but hopeful. It is quite nice really. Battle themes are quite exciting, really like how they did this.

Battle System:

This game works off of an expanding battle system. As you get deeper more mechanics unlocks. The stats are pretty basic, HP, SP, ATK, DEF. Crit hits are unlocked later on. Anyway, there is a multiplier in the game, and there are various things you can do to increase it. Depending on the situation, you might find yourself using some more creative methods which is nice. The game also has a feature called Skill Ring. In short, installing skills into the slot increases their level. This does varies things, such as improving the multiplier, status effects, etcs.

Crit hits does double damage, guarantees status affliction, and ignores enemy drop conditions. They will drop all items if it dies on a crit.

Needless to say, it has a lot going for it in this regard. 

Crafting:

Crafting works in the way of find recipes and making the materials. From there, you go to the villagers to make what you need. These can be items, equipment, battle items, tools for gathering etc. 

Map:

The map works by a point and click for the field, with some areas you can manually move in. These are the gathering areas. When you clear a stage, most can keep skipped the next time you visit.

Overall:

This is an amazing game, from end to end it is a high quality experience. And if anything, I am positive you'll find yourself immersed into the story. There are slight translation issues, but nothing concerning. Anyway, head on in and enjoy this great game. I am usually reluctant to play these sort of games, since they can never get it right. However, this one far surpassed my expectations.",1,1698728928,2097,0,57
3157,1482820,"Yes its a 1st person shooter. Like XCOM etc.
But its kinda easy.
Once you have upgraded your crew to the top level and recruited the right crew mix you will walk through everything.
The right mix: couple of snipers and make sure you get area effect weapons for everyone else - they kill or damage multiple enemies in one shot. 
Thats all you need to walk through most scenarios.
Oh - and move slowly with a scout and leapfrog tactics.
Do not go, bull at a run - you will walk into ambushes and get team members killed.
Last:
Good game - needs it to go further - AI needs to be a bit more intelligent as it does not use area effect weapons really well - this is your advantage.

Do not advance with your last crew member on that turn - you have been warned.

[b]Dance Waifu[/b] is a lewd hidden object game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Collect hidden records to strip the dance club! There are twenty records to find, each incrementing the ""Music Hotness"" about five-percent. When the Hotness is raised to one-hundred percent, the game is effectively won, and each character will go topless.

[h1]Story[/h1]
There is no story (and I'm not making one up!)

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen is a bit messy, but I enjoy the animations. Strangely, the titlemenu can only be manipulated using the keyboard (as opposed to the mouse cursor). There is no way to adjust audio or display preferences.

3184,1482940,"I've played this game long enough that it has finally scratched that itch that I've had for so long for the Prince of Persia games from the early 90s.

The objective is deceptively simple - find keys, unlock a door, and go to the next realm/level.  There are a plethora of weapons, powerups/pets, potions to empower you, water to replenish your waning health and numerous classes to chose from to unlock and experiment with, each with its unique sets of strength/skills.

What makes the game truly test your skill isn't whether or not you have a good memory.  After awhile, you'll get to absorb the level you're on but while that may help you navigate from point A to B, the key that you thought was in a pit is no longer there and that treasure chest that you found so early?  Well, it's not there either - and that's because the items will move upon every fresh attempt so you will definitely want to keep your wits and skill with you as you progress through this rogue-lite game chock full of ranged attackers, devastating melee punchers, as well as devious traps that can either poison or confuse you.  

Think you remember where that scorpion was before?  Or that arrow trap?  Nope, those move too.  Everything will change and the only thing that you'll remember is where all the rooms, crevasses, and caves are...which may not serve you well enough to progress to the next challenge.

Music is whimsical, but definitely in keeping with the environment that you're traversing and the polygons serve equal parts nostalgia as well as modern in terms of their artistic reverence for classical games but modern responses to lighting effects in the current generation.

All in all, I think you'll enjoy Rumours From Elsewhere - I've been playing the demo for quite some time now and I'm glad that it's finally here in all its glory.

I love the look of the game, and it has a ton of character in everything you play as, kill, pick up, or read. Not to mention the sound design and music are great. Once I got used to the core mechanics, I was hooked and kept starting new runs to discover more about the game. Each of the characters feels unique, just as each of the areas are distinct, vibrant, and fun (except Misty Peaks, that place is agony).

On the downside, sometimes the platforming is just a little unwieldy. The jumping or dashing or platform grabbing seemed to occasionally glitch and caused me some significant frustration. This didn't ruin the game by any means, but it did feel like an unfair game flaw that would crop up now and again. Also, here and there a hit box would be in dire need of updating.

Overall, I think this game is still satisfying to play. Before buying, people should be aware that a map is basically the same on each run (it is random which maps you encounter), but the game encourages you to speed through each level to find randomly placed features. I think this helps the gameplay loop overall as you learn the layouts and mechanics, making for quick and engaging action.",1,1629335077,1917,0,1

The current price of 10 dollars is really worth it and on sale it's an absolute steal.",1,1655637585,2353,0,3

3190,1482940,"This game is incredibly charming, even if I am not very good at it haha
The art style is lovely- the level design, playable characters, available weapons and even pet are all very fun and look great! And while I found some of the controls a little finicky to get used to (namely wall jumping/climbing) once I got the hang of it it played very smooth.

My only complaint personally, is there is a story-built timer to the levels, that I wish was optional. 
After a certain amount of time the difficulty spikes because you're being followed by an instant death boss. It's assumed you would have managed to finish the level by then.
I however, as mentioned above, am not particularly good at this game, so I can't seem to make it out of the level before I start being chased RIP
I end up feeling really rushed, and not able to take the time to explore/collect items, which has always been part of the appeal of these kinds of games for me, especially one that looks as good as this one!

That said, seeing other's responses and comments it seems most people do finish the levels before the chase starts, or the chase happens when they're nearly finished and provides a last second bit of adrenaline, so it isn't usually a problem, so don't let my trash playing scare you off from a challenge lmao

If you like games that are challenging, with great artwork, I HIGHLY recommend this game!",1,1651286541,340,0,1
3191,1482970,"Have mixed feelings about this one...
I mean, it's a fair price point even without a discount, I guess, but it is both short and a bit underwhelming.

It starts with a good concept that few other games rarely take on and sticks to it partly to its detriment in the restrained variety of parts and enemies from which to get them, and even has a bunch of boxes around which contain guaranteed parts in case you're not getting them from the enemies' random chance for some reason. I kind of expected more... variance? Like, the stats that each part has are fair considering how they're the same that the enemies have, but I feel like there ought to have been more game mechanics based on which body parts you had and/or if you were using a complete set, like a change to the double jump or a dash move or something (anything!) besides the basic controls + the two weapons you can have at a time (+ the spinal enhancement for a third potentially).

Story is pretty much ""you are awakened and bad stuff is going on"" kind of trope. Specifically some kind of virus affecting robots on an exo planet populated exclusively by robots who have been freed from their human masters in a war in the past. The ending is both unexpected and weird, makes you think that there were probably a lot of things left unfinished or that the game was itself finished early as a kind of concept proof rather than a full game. I did skip over one of the areas (completely optional, I might add,) which might have maybe explained more? Bunker 6, I'll never know who lived inside you... because I don't intend to go there after finishing the game, to be honest: it's not like I'm missing some great piece of literature or anything, with even the few bits of English containing Engrish.

Was fun enough, I guess. Wouldn't have minded if it was a lot more expanded in scope but I guess this is what we got. Also, pretty sure there's some buggy things going on and the currency you're supposed to drop on death stops dropping, making the already fast game artificially slower because of it.

https://youtu.be/dlSWK9pyBk4
One More Dungeon 2 is an Indie, First Person, Action Roguelike Dungeon Crawler, an FPS RPG packing 
Procedural Generation and powerful weapons, artifacts, and relics to find.
One More Dungeon 2 is good.

[h1]The Dungeon: Ziggurat + Zelda? Kinda[/h1]
One More Dungeon 2 feels a bit like Ziggurat, mixed with a little bit of old school Zelda. 
Like in Ziggurat, defeated enemies drop exp crystals, and, much like Ziggurat, when you lvl, you pick 1 of 3 upgrades.
These upgrades might instantly heal you to full, grant extra inventory or relic slots, grant bonus hp, or increase the amount of doom you can handle before being cursed; very useful stuff here.

Unlike in Ziggurat, you don’t have to kill everything to progress to the next room; you can just run past and try to avoid hits if you want; good; making the game more of an interconnected dungeon with shared dangers, as opposed to a series of randomized challenge rooms.
The original Zelda also often sealed you into rooms, forcing you to clear all the monsters to proceed; One More Dungeon 2 does not do that aside from boss battles.
Like in Zelda, you run around, smashing pots and barrels, hoping to find goodies inside.

Like in Zelda, there are traps in the dungeons, and they hurt, so watch where you step!
Cracked walls can be bombed, just like in Zelda, and you can find the dungeon map to help guide your way.
Sometimes, enemies will even drop hp too; nice!

And, much like in old school Zelda, you can find powerful items, artifacts, and relics that change how you play, think the magic boomerang, the candle, or the wand.
Here, in One More Dungeon 2, you have Relics you can find in the randomized dungeons, which grant permanent buffs to your current run if equipped; think always dealing max damage on a melee hit, or finding more crystals, or dealing more melee damage; handy.

Also, there are fun artifacts, like the skull that turns nearby bodies into gold! At the cost of all your stamina!
It feels like One More Dungeon 2 pulled the best bits from the two above games and combined them to makes something that feels like its own fun, dungeon crawling thing;  good work.

[h1]The Combat: [/h1]
Unlike old School Zelda, In One More Dungeon 2, there is no bump damage by default here, and enemies must make an attack to hurt you; good.
One More Dungeon 2 also has fun and varied weapons like a spike stave that blasts out shards of thorns when an enemy is hit, or one that fires an acid blade that cuts through enemies in a line; fun!
Or a cursed blade that is very powerful, but curses you, (just a little bit) every swing you take with it. 
These curses, which build up via doom, are negative perks, like 25% less hp, crystal weapons doing 33% less damage, or you find less money, stuff like that, adding some real cost to getting hit by certain nasty monsters, desecrating tombs, or wielding cursed artifacts. 
Is it worth it? You decide!

[h1]Classes: [/h1]
There are many different classes in One More Dungeon 2, like the default Stranger, who has the ability to regenerate health over time, plus 6 more to unlock!
The Warrior: more hp, and heal more from found food, but crystal weapons cost 50% more to use; their special power is Berserk: 100% more weapon damage and 50% taken damage.
The Wizard: Crystal weapons consume 33% less crystals; special power: Synthesis, magic wands do not use crystals and their rate of fire is increased. Pew, Pew, Pew!
The Paladin: Has a shield, blocking attacks build rage, and using artifacts increase your doom lvl; special ability damage enemies in sight; starts with a mace, and holy water, 2 healing potions, and 1 bomb, but does not start with a crystal staff, so no ranged option by default.

[h1]Meta Progression:[/h1]
Runes are the Meta Currency here, used to unlock additional classes , small stat increases, like +5 hp, +5 energy, +5 doom counter, access to a merchant, where you can spend earned gold in the caste for some additional starting crystals or bombs, small stuff like that, and unlocking more additional rooms in the castle that have more stuff to unlock; fun!

Controller support is present, as is good old mouse and keyboard; the usually superior choice in first Person games.
I much preferred the mouse and keyboard controls here, so that is what I used above.

[b]I only have 2 Suggestions:[/b]

[h1]1: Mark The Shops Please. [/h1]
Shops should be marked on the map once discovered, same thing for slime statues.

[h1]2: Consider Creature Spawners[/h1]
Creature spawners that the player cannot enter; think sewer grates that rats scurry through, slimes ooze through, or tentacles reach through, trying to grab at the player as they pass by; creepy!
Think low passages the player is too wise to try to crawl though, as it would mean their slow, painful demise, as the short little critters in there would poke and gnaw you apart as you lie dying on your hands and knees.
The player could attempt to kill all the creatures crawling out for the experience and maybe loot, or try to collapse, block, or blow the passage to stop the creatures spawns.

Maybe these passages could link to deeper lvls of the dungeon, and if you kill the creatures here, they might not be present at their home depth, as perhaps they raid up here for resources to draw back down in the depths.
Perhaps, now that their gone, someone even nastier has moved up from below, and takes their place in the dark…
Fun and immersive things like that.

Anyway, One More Dungeon 2 is an Indie, First Person, Action Roguelike Dungeon Crawling, FPS RPG packing Procedural Generation and powerful weapons, artifacts, and relics to find, and it is one I enjoyed.
One More Dungeon 2 is easily worth a wishlist and a watch.

玩了，后期Boss设计相当烦人，至少暗示一下用什么道具可以帮忙打。而且怎么boss伤害这么高，黑魂都没这么整。两三下就被打死，打个boss都能肝死人. 然后游戏中也没什么提示，就跑来跑去，都不知道要做什么。剧情设计的太乱了，还不如做个简单易懂的剧情。",1,1641477345,1334,0,94

I'm only giving this a positive review because it's so cheap, and I believe it's worth a few bucks for a few hours of chaotic fun before you've seen pretty much everything this game has to offer. Still, an actual survivorlike will offer a much better bang for your buck (I only mention survivorlikes because the description compares this to Vampire Survivors).

It successfully replicates that feeling in GTA when you just want to destroy stuff and rack up stars, but that's all it is. The survivorlike or roguelike elements don't have enough depth to add much beyond that. For instance, there aren't that many power-ups, and the ones that exist are pretty boring (the clown character's special ability is that he can reroll them, but there are so few that you'll commonly get the same ones). The procedural generation also doesn't add enough variety to make each city seem fresh or unique.

3276,1482430,"A very enjoyable little game. It's like simon's quest without all the bs. Pixel art is amazing, especially the parallax backgrounds. The music fits perfectly as well, it's a very relaxing experience.

There are challenging platform sections as well. They were fun and never frustrating. The combat is basic but very stylish. Half way through i realized you could just hold down the attack button instead of mashing it, which made aerial combat much easier. The bosses were fun, but the last few did drag on a little bit too long imo.

I'm usually not into story driven 2D games, but the story here wasn't bad. Simona is kind of a smart ass, but still likable. I  missed a few things on my first playthrough and can't go back to collect them unfortunately. Although the game does warn you of that. Not a big deal though since the game is short, so I'll probably replay it soon.

A great game for the price, check it out!",1,1619620512,181,0,4
3277,1482430,"TLDR: Simona's Requiem is a dinky little Metroidvania wrapped up in a pretty pixel-art package.  Slower than your average platformer, the game relishes its stress-free and gentle pace, allowing the player to work their way through the game without the fear of losing hours of gameplay.  Well recommended.

Visually, the game juxtaposes crisp pixel art with stylishly-drawn character portraits during conversational cut-scenes.  Various parallax layers add a wonderful sense of depth into the game's backgrounds, some of which are spectacular to behold.  It apes plenty from an obvious inspiration in Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, but everything is well animated and easily to distinguish.

To my frustration I played most of the game with lowered volume, however the game's soundtrack fits well with its laid-back aesthetic.  It's a welcome change of pace from your traditional up-tempo soundtracks.  I shall be listening more closely on subsequent playthroughs.

A game lives and dies on its gameplay, and fortunately Simona's Requiem is solid in almost every aspect.  Though the character movement is achingly slow, control is tight and responsive.  As a Metroidvania, it gradually adds additional abilities to allow for traversal through the game world, and the level design telegraphs the different ways to use these abilities well.  Enemy placement is fair, getting a little bit more fiendish as the game reaches its climax.

One criticism I have is for the final few bosses.  The first few bosses in the game are relatively brief affairs, well designed to allow for straightforward reading of attacks and patterns.  At the end of the game, however, they become much longer and slower.  This is a combination of random patterns and small attack windows.  I mainly bring this up because the rest of the game, though slow from a movement perspective, is surprisingly quick and direct.  It doesn't blight the game, however it's such a distinct change from the rest of the game that I felt it important to note.

The last thing I wish to mention is the script.  The storyline makes limited sense, which isn't such an issue.  The main character is witty, biting, and genuinely funny at times.  However, the game is littered with spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors - for example, the word ""perform"" is misspelled both times it is featured in game.  For such a well-rounded package, these errors are the only thing that make it *feel* like a low-price indie game.  Again, this isn't a deal breaker, but for a native English speaker it's jarring to see these mistakes in such volume.

I've really enjoyed my time with Simona's Requiem, and as I haven't seen everything the game has to offer, I intend to play it further.  Worth a purchase!",1,1619612475,160,0,8

Simona's Requiem is best described as a platformer with metroidvania elements that in part evokes the early Castlevania's style. However its quite neither a Castlevania nor a real metroidvania.

Undead crowd the walkways and worse critters lurk around too.

The whole of the game is rather short, and there are a few gripes to be had, but overall it is a fun little experience. My gripes are: That its a bit pricey at full price for what is there. That Simona's walking speed is dreadfully slow till you get the dash. That the respawn rate for enemies is frankly way, way too high. Beyond those inconveniences though?

3326,1481630,"I like this game! The core mechanics are fun, snappy, and require some serious thinking if you want to get the maximum number of gears for buying upgrades. Each mech is a puzzle that scratches a particular itch and with each mech you discover there's more to scratch. I think the creators did a great job to set up the game in such a way that a lot of content can be added in the future. The scenarios, enemies, and obstacles are diverse and keep you engaged. 

There are a few things that I miss rather than dislike. First, I miss a narrative. It's clear what we're doing, but not really why we're doing what we're doing. Perhaps that just me and maybe a narrative doesn't make sense here. Second, I would prefer a more involved unlocking scheme for the mechs as in ""complete a level without using card X"" or ""kill no bugs in scenario Y"". Third, I think the upgrade system could be more elaborate or involved.

Overall, I really enjoyed playing Command Line Pilot and I'm excited to see what the creators will do next with this game. (Yes, more mechs!)",1,1627226368,351,0,2

3330,1481630,"Command-Line Pilot is a card-based rogue-lite game where piecing together tactics based on what's available each turn and be very flexible is key. The graphics are simple, and mechanics simple, and the game can be frustrating when the right card won't come, but you feel a sense of accomplishment when you finish the missions and unlock a new mech to play with and some new missions. 

The backstory is minimal: you control some sort of a mech, and due to whatever limitations, you can only issue it orders through these... cards, with simple orders like move, turn, and shoot. If you play several cards of the same color suite, you get level 2 or even level 3 powers, like move twice, turn 180 instead of 90, and so on. You have up to 4 cards to play per turn, and the order is important. 

Your enemies have little logic other than they want to touch you, and scramble your electronics so you either end up with random facing, or have your card deck scrambled (two adjacent cards change places), or worse! As you don't know how you will move until you get the deck revealed, this can get really... hairy at times. 

The objectives vary, from getting X kills to take out 2 specific objectives, or just not get touched for X turns. And once you ""finished"" the few missions for that mech, you unlock a new mech with a different deck, and new challenges. 

The price is low, and the play is interesting enough that you can give it a try. I personally think the deck should be a bit larger so you get more ""choices"" on what to play, but that's just me. Developer is actively seeking comments and even has a dedicated key to press so you can share your thoughts. For the low-low price, I'd say at least give me a try.",1,1628625212,27,0,458

The weapon handling of the 19th century (?) inspired guns is fun. The idea of wild west, old weapons and zombies works really well.

In my opinion it is ok for the price. Just remember it is early access. Hopefully there will be more maps and maybe even more weapons someday.

Playing on HP Reverb G2, and yes, it works well enough, but could be better. Changing guns in the heat of the battle is not ideal, better have one of the big buttons to swap through than just being able to do it with the right thumbstick.

Switching platforms / teleporting to another platform should be improved. Holding down and letting go of the left thumbstick while precicely pointing on the platforms yellow markers... that does not work well. Shooting the platform with an arrow in Elven Assassins was easy and precise in comparison.

Other than that, great and fun new variant of Elven Assassins. Bit low on other players still.

I even got to talk with the Dev during a stream and he was very open to opinions and you see that the developer care for his game as he already release a few patch notes!

The only thing I could say about this game is that we found the game maybe lacking in terms of number of levels. Sure you have the hardcore mode too but this is essentially the same levels but with an upgraded difficulties. I would have like to see either more tougher holes (exemple add more holes, add some trash to the ground, etc.)
A more hardcore mode would have been good to!

Nonethe less the game has great potential and i'm sure that if there's enough love for his game the dev will work towards making his game even better!!

Keep up the good work!!

I'm not much for the interactive fiction genre - my most memorable experience is with the old Infocom ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" growing up, so I'm a bit out of date. Still, this is a charming piece with a clever little gimmick: you are the detective in a murder mystery who's called everyone to the parlor to reveal all the dark secrets, except you don't know a dang thing and have to stall and babble. (And twirl your moustache. Very important, that.) A single run-through isn't going to take very long, I've already finished it once, but there are clearly more endings and secrets to find than I did, in fact, find.

I'm not sure I'm going to go back to it to dig all those extra endings and secrets out, to be perfectly honest. Don't take this as a criticism of the game itself - if it failed, it was only in that it didn't rekindle some long-lost love for interactive fiction games. And that's fine. For me, it was a one-off into a genre I don't usually explore, and I appreciated how succinct and direct it was while still playing to its premise. I like those one-offs into things I don't usually do; maybe I'll come back to it, maybe I won't. I'm quite happy with what I spent on it in both time and money, and would gladly gift it to someone interested in a little slice of the genre.",1,1610387293,40,0,24

With this money you have a little jump start ... but nothing more. Honestly what are 5 $

I had a minor issue with this game, which is detailed at the end.

- Pieces click into place and cannot be removed once they are in the correct place.
- Puzzles are small, relaxing, and not challenging at all.
- Background is entirely dark black, making it difficult to see pieces at all.
- I had an issue with pieces ""dropping"" as I moved them, but cannot be certain if that is a glitch or just a hardware issue with my mouse.
- ""5 Minute"" achievement requires you to sit in a puzzle for 5mins, not just have the game running for 5 mins.


Unfortunately i had to restart an entire puzzle because of a combination of two things: 
1. The ""dropping"" issue where sometimes my mouse will drop the puzzle piece and it'll be hard to pick it back up, usually clicking on the outermost part of the piece will work.
2. The black background in this game is so dark that it is literally impossible to see an entirely black piece, on top of the other entirely black pieces.

3425,1481210,"I'm gonna give a full honest review of this game.
Would I recommend it? Yes I would but after a lot of flaws are taken out of it.

There's quite a bit of flaws on this game from not being able to drop items, to hud not changing correctly, bugs with the ""ghosts"" where they don't do what is expected, over clipping of a certain area when looking for a certain ""ghost"" with another, etc.

Do I think the game is fun? Yes but to a certain extent. 
Personally I had more fun making fun of the ghost than actually getting scared, they only spawned in one spot at most points, place more spawn points and movements like having some crawl on the ceiling or reaching from behind the player to grab them and spin them around to the entity, or their item, there's no microphone use in game either to trigger things like the board to move it was more or less let it sit there and it'll move.

What are things that I like about it? I love the open world concept, the ability to hunt more than just one ghost, the cooperative concept with others, the different variations of ghosts. 

It's just not scary

Overall score I will rate this a 2.5/5 for the time being. Once there has been more things done to the game I will look back into this and re evaluate, I hope my recommendations also help out to better the experience for others aswell.

3431,1481210,"I find it to be interesting and normally I would avoid horror type games. Note that the tutorial is currently horrible and does not fully reflect what the game has to offer. It's a little better to try this with people than to try it out yourself and try to learn it's rather high learning curve bit by bit to understand what this game has to offer. 

What I hope to see is to have later is an option for controllers and actual voice chat as I had to chat in Discord to hear and speak to other people.

Edit November 8, 2023: Just recently I've been seeing new streamers try to play and only did the tutorial and find it boring. Again, this is intended to be a group game, so playing alone and JUST the tutorial (which only has one paranormal entity) is unfair to give it the comments that some have given on their streams. It may suck to convince a friend or two to also buy this game or to hopefully find others (as few people are playing this game) who are on at the same time as you and play with them to get a better experience, but playing alone is NOT recommended.

Now, some obvious problems currently: the games graphics seem to be glitched as for some, they may not be seeing or exactly what another person is. For example, for me, the breaker in a building can be broken, and I couldn't see the sparks, but others can. For others, they can't see pictures getting 'stolen', but the host can.

Now the difficulty as of now is pretty difficult, particularly the Mystics. I expect the update that will give more characters is the counter to that, but I bet we'll see if there will be an eventual separate difficulty mode aside from what the map contains.",1,1698233787,5491,0,14

- HQ textures and sounds
- Different types of buses to choose from
- Very well tuned manual shifting
- Manly horn

/CONS/
- All buses develop a high pitched noise above 40 kph (drives me crazy)
- Automatic transmission is tuned very badly (at first, it seems to be stuck in first gear, then it shifts in a very weird way)
- I could not get the heating to work properly in buses without the AC unit

3453,1481490,"Ok, so lemme post something on here besides ""game good, skin nice.""

Game is alright as is rn, depending on who you are or what kinda things you are into, you can squeeze a couple hours of gameplay out before you start to realizing that you are looking for the same objective, on the same 3-4 maps, and you dont even really HAVE to do the objective because you can indeed just wait for the other team to 90% the bar on the winch then steal it real quick.

The combat? has to be one of the worst things about the game so far. As it stands right now, I have only played Robin and whatever the stabby lady's name is, playing these 2 characters goes a little like; Press M1, watch clunky attack animation and tracking (there is no combo potential btw unless you count throwing out a single attack and then pulling out your arrows as a ""combo"".) get dumpster-ed by a John or Tooka. In my opinion, stab lady has to be the weakest character out of the 4
The stealth and difficulty to pull this stealth off on NPCs is like taking candy from a diabetic baby. Like putting the circle shape into the square hole. Its easy af but there is a lingering feeling of something being wrong. And that's because there IS!
The stealthing is dumbed down pretty hard, any of my fellow stealth lovers are prob gonna be very disappointed with it. I can show you clips of me just walking right up in a guard's face around multiple targets and barely so much as getting a ""huh.... what was that?"" 
I would like to see these 2 things played around with, maybe consider adding combos or raising stealth difficulty. Or maybe even let you select the difficulties of the heists.
If the main goal of this game is more stealth than anything then I can almost sort of see why the actual unstealth fighting is so not great but even the stealth is just not right as is right now.

Is the game worth the price currently? mm, no not really. Is it fun? sure, I've yet to play with any friend on it yet but solo play has been alright.

[b]SecreD – Foot Art[/b] is a lewd slider-puzzle game with a theme on feet.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Slide tiles into the correct positions to sort an image. There are twenty puzzles total, with difficulties ranging between four and nine pieces. Each puzzle is either timed or movement limited. The latter can be rather troublesome if you’re inexperienced with slider puzzle strategy. Thankfully, the game unsorts each image in front of your eyes — if you pay close attention, you can solve puzzles by effectively reversing the movement of the computer. Slider puzzles are stupid hard if you don’t know how to solve them, and stupid easy if you know how.

[h1]Story[/h1]
There is no story (and I’m not making one up!)

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen is one of the worst I’ve seen. Not only are the selections blurry, the don’t make sense either. What do targets have to do with “foot art”‘? And the color palate is horrendous! There is no way to adjust user-preferences, such as audio or display. The application is permanently windowed, and it cannot be fullscreened whatsoever. CGs can be previewed, but there is no proper gallery — even if there was, the images are not in the correct aspect ratio to be borderless fullscreened.

[b]- The Goods -[/b]
There are twenty static CGs to see, [b]one[/b] of which featuring nudity. The art style between CGs varied wildly. Some CGs offer a 3D rendered babe, and others generic anime waifus. Though the word “feet” is part of the game’s name, there doesn’t seem to be a strong focus on feet. Overall, the artwork is below average and generic.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Wait for the developer to fix their game, [b]LOL[/b]. The game literally soft-locked after completing a level because the ""X"" button was displayed offscreen. The display errors [b]SecreD - Foot Art[/b] experiences are awful -- did anyone test this game before release? The artwork is as generic as can be. If you're someone that likes stock waifus, you're better off with a Google Image search. Even if you [b]like[/b] slider-puzzles, there are stronger titles for similar price points. I don't recommend this game.

But yet...I found myself having more fun than I would like to admit. The hands-on-steering does take a while to get used to, but in the end, I was enjoying the handful of tracks as well as the tournaments. Heck, I even found myself able to drift-slide around some of the corners which felt great in VR. Having said that VR is clearly a bolt-on here and I feel the game does need to be cheaper given the lack of content. But I did have a few smiles, so I will give it a very cautious thumbs up.

3473,1480740,"Doomsday Room... A game that came out on the same day as my 16th birthday. When I first saw this game while browsing down in Steam, I first thought that the concept might be interesting. So I waited a while, I saved some money and then bought the game. The first time I played this game I was a little bit disappointed that this game was not that satisfying for me. The game was not bad or didn't have bugs or anything but I overestimated what this game could offer. But after playing for a while I think that this game is worthwhile. To put it mildly this game offers a cold-war scenerio that you can role play in it. Being a diplomat in the UN and trying to solve or create crises was entertaining. While playing this game I felt that this game was very similar but an advenced version of a browser game called ""Three Minutes to Midnight"" which is a game you can play on browser at itch io. This game also felt similar to the game ""Cold War 2"" which is also a browser game. All in all the game was enough and offers some variety in it that can keep you occupied for a while.

Before evaluating this game with a score, I would like to mention something that I think the developer should also consider. This game is expensive. Well, I am living in Turkey and this game costs 32 Turkish liras and as far as I checked from the internet this game costs 20 dollars in US. Although this game is a full game that can be played without encountering any bugs and has potential to be improved in my opinion this price is one of the reasons why this game is not getting many reviews (I mean the sales are not that high). Revising the price policy might be a good idea.

Lasty for the developer (since this is a relatively small game I hope he will read this): This game has potential, do not stop improving and adding new features to this game, I really enjoy it. I even votes this game for game developing championship, there are not that many independent developers that works on this type of games.

I've always wanted to find something similar to old games like Balance of Power / Shadow President, and while this isn't going to replace that game for me, it certainly has elements of that game that are presented well.

It can be difficult at times to see how your choices will impact the short/long term issues.

An example: Nordland appeared to be just into the red, but things kept getting to Defcon 1. I couldn't figure out why this was happening and this is what eventually triggered a Nuclear war. They nuked us all.

3491,1480810,"[h1][b]Well, isn't that a very frustrating surprise[/b][/h1] 
In all fairness I should've read the reviews of people saying the game is unfinished. I was truly enjoying the game when I got to ""the end"" and realized that the game isn't finished, so let's go with the pros and cons:

[h2][b]PROS[/b][/h2]
- For those of us who are big fans of Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre and Fire Emblem the game seems to provide almost all aspects that made those franchises so beloved.
- Although the  sprite art style isn't my favorite, the face arts and the characters are absolutely gorgeous.
- The dialog doesn't feel out of place for the setting proposed.
- The spells can be learnt either by leveling according to your character's element affinity or through codexes that you can either buy or drop from enemies which I particularly appreciated as being a different way of acquiring them.
- Multi-classing, much like FFT you are able to have different jobs for your characters and build them at your will.
- Depending of the map you can have up to 10 characters deployed
- Fast forward up to 3x on battles
- Different weapons have different areas of effect making melee units more interesting than your regular one square area for any single melee weapon.

[h2][b]CONS[/b][/h2]
- Well, the biggest one is definitely that the game doesn't feel finished - the game ends at a point where I would see as the middle of the journey.
- As mentioned above, I am not crazy about the sprite art of this game as I think they would benefit a lot from having something pixel ish or something similar to Sword of Convallaria, but this is just a personal preference.
- [u]BUGS, BUGS, BUGS everywhere[/u] - I had to re-start a couple of battles due to some basic bugs such as my character dying due to an ability used by themselves but the game didn't registered the death, which lead this character to be un-revivable and the turn sequence stuck when it was their turn. This is only an example among many.
- The spells and magic doesn't look so good often repeating the same animation for different spells and God who thought that Hypothermia would be a creative name for an ice spell?
- Monts...listen, I love the idea of having a dragon/horse riders as much as the next guy - the execution here though...the mounts often did more harm than otherwise. And if you add a mount to your characters, good luck trying to find a way to dismount them since a unit mounted count as 2. Apart from the dragon rider I didn't use mounts at all. If anything they were just annoying and not worth it.
- Sounds. The music is fine, nothing groundbreaking but what I really missed was a death scream sound whenever a unit falls, I guess I got spoiled by FFT on this. The attack sounds could've been crispier and better designed as it doesn't sound so good when a sword/axe is slashing or any other weapons in fact.

[h2][b]Last considerations:[/b][/h2]

For a 30 bucks game it doesn't deliver, specially when you reach the point where I'd think the game is reaching the middle part but it is in reality the end. If you don't really care for the story (which I hardly think that people into this genre of game don't) it can be entertaining, but honestly not worth it.",0,1722436425,2042,1905,1
3492,1480810,"This game is ostensibly like final fantasy tactics, but the game balance feels ... off.

I'm by no means a power player, but I've played my fair share of FFT, Ogre tactics, X-com (the original and Gollop brother's versions when it first came out, and the firaxis versions), and how difficult the game is, how long the individual battles take, and how (un)fun it is ... is just off.

Chasing mages with your warriors all across the board is no fun (there is no opportunity attack in this game, no hex control, so if you run your warrior up right next to their mage, their mage can just run off next turn and blast your face with a lightning bolt)

You can't hide your mages behind you warriors. Magical arching longbow shots snipe them 10/10 even when they're crouching behind your hulking knight in full plate armour.

I understand there's an internal logic to the strategy to every game, but this is just not a pleasurable learn.

Gave it a few hours, and I'm probably not touching it ever again.",0,1720798486,436,0,5
3493,1480810,12-15 hour game. I don't think its worth $30. pick it up on sale if you are like me and really craving turn based strategies. The game has solid ideas but it feels incomplete. Game ends abruptly which pisses me off more than anything. Feels very incomplete. Mounts are worthless. I did enjoy the different combinations of classes you can do. I know the whole background with the devs and what they decided to do.,0,1721822849,8567,0,4
3494,1480830,"This game is beautiful and has great music and ambience.

However, it is terribly designed. Combat is repetitive and uninteresting. The map is a convoluted mess with terrible layout design. Moreover, the developer's refusal to add a map to the game adds insult to injury.

In Evil Tonight, you will constantly find locked doors mixed up with a million other doors and rooms leading every which way with no rhyme or reason. Locked doors will have a symbol associated to them you can only see by inspecting them or getting close enough to touch them. You will find keys to these doors scattered elsewhere in the game. And there is no way to know which key corresponds to which door, other then tracing your steps back through the maze of criminally badly laid out hallways and rooms, and checking each one. Another option would be to take screenshots, and making a pen and paper map yourself (great choice for a game that strongly recommends a controller to play it).

The game touts itself as being an ""old school"" survival game, but only pays lip service to what modern gamers might think ""old school"" survival was like. Maps were essential in games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, especially when presented in-game in a lore friendly way, such as sketched, incomplete or faded out pieces of paper with no player indicator. Even when they had no maps, those types of games would at least be well designed, so that the player would be able to find things logically, either by using familiar locations with standarized layouts (schools) or by cordoning off the action as the player progressed. Evil Tonight just goes the lazy route and gives you no map to navigate its samey labyrinth of generic haunted house hallways. And gloats about it.

In reality, it feels like a lazy attempt to inflate what according to other people is an already short game with pointless backtracking.

The story and the setting failed to capture my interest. All the game gives you in the way of an introduction is to suggest a cliched haunted manor horror story setup, and before you are presented with any actual novel mystery that might draw you in, you are quickly thrown into the action. A serviceable but bland combination of hunting sparkly sprites scattered throughout gorgeous pixel art scenery and repetitive 2D realtime combat.

All in all, it feels overambitious. You are shown glimpse of about 10 characters in a matter of 15 minutes. All with cringe-worthy one liners replete with the worst attempts at being quirky. The problem is, you don't have any time to bond with them as a player before they consider themselves established as ""familiar"", the protagonist included. Much like her, this game appears to be all looks and no substance.

3513,1480870,"Okay, after thinking for a bit I am changing my review to this game to a positive. I had previously negatively reviewed this game because when I bought it, you could not play it. It would endlessly load (And if you think I'm being impatient, I went to get a covid shot while having the game load at home. Getting the shot took about two hours and a half- maybe more- and when I came back home the game was still loading.) 

However, with the new update it had fixed the problem for me. Now experiecing the game is pretty realistic and fun to play, although it's not without it's bugs. I find singleplayer a better experience (aka, in an empty server by yourself because there's no real singleplayer) because multiplayer can be quite buggy for me. I joined a server with players and somebody's player model glitched so badly it became a giant spotty blob and consumed half of the map then lagged me so hard I got an error message and crashed. (I got a screenshot of it! Would include a photo if steam reviews allowed that.) 

Hunting mechanics are cool, although I would like if there was a tutorial on how to play that holding game thing? There's this circle with a dot going in a circle and into a darker area quick-time event thing for specific prey items that I assume you need to click something, except I'm not being told exactly what I need to press?

Anyways, the graphics. Although I play on the lowest settings due to lag, I got to say the models and carcass details are very realistic. I love the detail of whenever you eat prey you get blood on your mouth for a bit, adds to the realism. Also the sun reflects in the water, which is really cool! 

During night-time, I would really like some kind of night-vision button like in The Isle and other animal survival games though because it can be really hard to see at times. 

Also, anyone having trouble with lag, I'd advise you try to keep your head down and look away from the sky. The sky at day-time is usually a lag causer for me. I tend to have a smoother experience when I look down, only small bits of the sky visible. Enough to look forward and see where im going but not enough to see the entire sky, y'know?

Personally I think you should be playing as a Cheetah not a Leopard with a game name like ""Lightning Fast"" but can't expect much from a game the developers dropped.

This game has potential, I can see it being popular if more is put into the game and the issues get fixed. The customization you can do for your leopard is nice, There's no way any two players would look exactly alike unless they didn't mess with it to much. The eye color needs fixed.

3543,1480960,"I can appreciate the attempt to do something different with the auto-battler genre, but I feel like what they changed doesn't actually [i]improve[/i] anything about auto-battlers. Particularly, I think removing the concept of ""Alliances"" lobotomizes the strategic side of the game, in favor of... nothing? 

I can understand they're trying to ""simplify"" the genre, but that's the thing... they didn't actually simplify anything. You still have to carefully min-max your ""collection"" (it's a deck, c'mon guys you can use the normal word) and if you don't, you'll lose as surely as playing random units in Dota Underlords or Teamfight Tactics. 

Part of the fun of auto-battlers is to react on the fly to what the game gives you, but the hard-limit of 5 potential unit draws and a handful of spells takes a lot of that away. Put simply: there isn't enough randomness in each ""hand"" to create the interesting scenarios and pivots that exist in other auto-battlers. You can tailor-make a deck, and you won't get a single card draw that isn't part of that premade deck. 

Within days, the meta will form, and it will be a straightforward Rock-Paper-Scissors scenario where you can instantly know if you'll win or lose based on the first fight, because you know exactly what deck they're running, and know it's impossible to win or lose whatever match up it is. This is exacerbated by the fact that the game is 1v1 instead of a 8 player Free-For-All like other auto-battlers. In those, at least, there's always the chance that someone who's countering your build will themselves be countered by someone else in the match, or that two or three players might be trying to go the same build, and therefore weaken each other enough for you to have a shot at victory.

- It's even more true regarding spells: You have 3 slots for spells in hand, and 10 spells in deck. There is one spell slot on each unit (2 slots at level 3, if you have enough luck to level them up), and you can't duplicate spells.
- Which means like you start each game with a very restrictive deck, no matter luck you can lose at loading screen due to both line-up and game balance: You can't have more than 5 units in the game, and your deck is filled with 5 units.

This gives you more control over the kind of board you'll be able to build in a match than any other autobattler I've played. This means the game doesn't really have the high and low rolls you might see in other autobattlers, for better or for worse. Instead, the game is more about the small tactical decisions and strategic considerations you make over the course of a match, as well as the initial construction of your pool of units and equipment.

Since this game is 1v1, there is a lot of room to react to what your opponent is doing and counteract it. One of the main avenues for this is the unit positioning. Every round, both players get to change the starting positions of some of their units. A very simple mechanic, but also very deep as the positions of units determine who they attack in battle.

The devs are very active in fixing bugs and making balance changes, and are very transparent about their plans for the future of the game.

3555,1480960,"I'm 40 years old. I've been playing games of all kinds for 30+ years.

This is the one of the most unbalanced tactical games I have ever played.

In this game, you can pick obviously overpowered units/powers, sit in a corner the whole game without moving units, and win.

In my opinion, the outcome is determined too often by what you/they picked (as units/powers) BEFORE the match even began.

Players should be able to start a game with a collection of 6 units, but be able to put only 5 on the board. There, fixed it for ya.

I'll come back in a month or two, I'm pretty sure it will be better. But right now, it's almost embarrassing. Some unit/power adjustments are so out of touch, they should never make it into the non-beta version of the game.

I'll still recommend the game for now, the potential is there.

***UPDATE**

I would not recommend this game anymore. RnG is a joke. Almost every single round's outcome is highly impacted by what you ""roll"" in the card panel. If you can upgrade a unit to the next level and your opponent can't, you win the next round. If it's the opposite, well, sorry, you lose.

Every single person playing this game since this game has come out, has 99.9999% of the time upgraded a unit if it could. So most of the time we're not even making a choice. We're just waiting for RnG to give us ""what everyone is waiting for, all the time, 100% of the game"".

Devs should decrease by at least 15% the health/DPS gained from a unit upgrade. Because right now ""pure RnG unit upgrade opportunities"" are a ""round changer"" every single matchup you go in,and it makes any other tactical decisions much less relevant.",1,1648014371,5988,0,58

Actually it is not the 100% same genre. Underlord and other auto battle game is a kind of RNG game that you need to calculate probability to get desired units and alliance ;HOWEVER, Godsbane is like a card game (that you have to build your deck like Magic and Heartstone) but with auto battle style.

The deckbuilding element is fairly simple, that's a good thing because it also means no insanely expensive decks and gigabrain tweaking every miniscule detail.

Do you entrench your carries behind defensive units? Or is it a constant back and forth about who can sneak his disablers in the right position for that round? Great game...

...That being said: It genuinely has a very discouraging new player experience: The starter deck is absolutely fucking awfull and you can't realisticly win any of your first matches. Once you get some units and all that you can craft your own strategy and start getting fair matches.

3586,1480960,"If, when you were young, you enjoyed setting up armies with your next door neighbor, wishing you could actually watch the armies fight, only to find yourself making up ad hoc rules and arguing with your friend about which unit can do what damage to whom -- then this is a game that you'll likely enjoy.

It nicely preserves the tabletop minis feel, while quite literally capturing a certain 90's ambiance, and a magical nostalgia for pewter figure collection. And then, of course, at the same time, it also provides that unspeakable joy and pleasure of watching your figures come to life in the context of arena-style gladiator battles.

You take actions across rounds, based on a budget of points, which you accrue on the basis of previous performance (previous round wins and losses, interest on saved/unspent points, etc). You use the points to deploy, level, and empower the units with special abilities. You make your purchases gradually over the course of the game, placing a few units/powers at a time during each round. Your purchase options at any given moment are limited to a semi-randomized subset of the items in your chosen ""deck"" (deck is comprised of 5 unit types, and 8 powers). To the extent you can't control the sequence of availability, this forces some tough decisions and tradeoffs over the course of the game, because you need to keep pace with the opponent's field presence from round to round, and cannot waste points either. So you sort of try to find the best way forward with the available resources. You can ""reshuffle"" and refresh your available options for a cost.

After you make your purchases during a round, you do a very limited scope of movement. Essentially, you can make two moves. The loser of the prior round moves last, giving an advantage. But the automated nature of the unit fighting makes this a tricky proposition, because you are largely speculating how movements will resolve into battle outcomes.

After movement is done, the fielded units immediately begin their to-the-death fighting. This is when you find out if your decisions were any good. It becomes something like autochess with a good deal of nailbiting at this point. You never quite know for sure how each round will pan out. I mean, oh boy! It can be super fun to watch!

What this all amounts to is a round-over-round buildup of strength, which incrementally shifts the battle in favor of one or the other player. You have time to think about each step, but not a ton. You're forced forward at a comfortable pace, but you can't dally, because every decision is timed. It gives the game a somewhat distinctive, calm-yet-tense rhythm, and prevents having to wait on your opponent indefinitely.

Anyhow, I've simplified some things, but I believe the above summary conveys the gist of the gameplay. There is a lot that I did not address, though, in terms of the interesting strategic options. Units have their strengths and weaknesses that play off one another, and there is, of course, the usual rock-paper-scissors sort of dynamic. You'll have to play to learn the nuances. The genuine depth of the game starts to reveal itself quite rapidly once you start playing.   

In my final analysis, I'd call this an exceptionally enjoyable game experience that has been cleverly engineered. It's not entirely novel. I see obvious shades of a lot of other games blended together. There are tropes drawn from other autobattlers for sure, as well as some lingering hints of magic the gathering (especially in the game's affinity for creative combos). But in this case, the sum is greater than the parts. It all feels really good. They seem to have worked out a lot of interesting mechanics that keep the play in balance.

Honestly, auto-battlers are not generally my thing. I've watched some Autochess and never really felt compelled to play it, but 30 hours in Godsbane is still a blast.

Playing several rounds against a single opponent means you have a much more clear and direct feedback loop on how your changes for that round fair against theirs. You could handedly win a round only to be destroyed the next because your positioning got messed up and now suddenly your main source of damage gets picked off early in the round. It also lets you get the feeling of having games that feel very close right up until the very end, which I don't get so much in larger round-robin autobattlers. Its a good feeling when it starts coming down to the wire and you lose a round but not hard enough to end the game, only to come back in the next round.

Since games are fairly short its also very low-effort to try out. You get a starting deck (which is the same for everyone) so you can jump straight in and from there you have the freedom to tailor your experience to your liking by first unlocking units that are most appealing to you either aesthetically or strategically. I find this a compelling aspect in and of itself and I'm sure it will only get more interesting as more content gets added (which the devs have already announced plans for).",1,1646474035,3772,0,2
3590,1480960,"Godsbane is a cool autobattler that feels very polished for such a small studio. The attention to detail such as the interactive toys in the main menu and the mini-game while queuing shows how much effort has been put into the game. Other than this there a bunch of fun elements although still some space to improve in future:

Pros:
 - A good variety of units and powers leads to many viable strategies in terms of deckbuilding.
 - Movement system brings a strong tactical feel to the gameplay.
 - Graphics and sound effects are impressive and impactful.
 - The quality of the game and menu interactions is very high, everything felt intuitive to use and there were no 
    points of confusion or bugs

Cons:
 - No Gold earned when playing vs AI so no way to grind up some new cards other than PVP
 - Some balancing is still necessary for a few units
 - Wack-a-Sol click boxes are bigger than visuals suggest

Went to the menu to see if I could skip ahead in the puzzle packs to the harder ones and see if they were any better for me, but they're all locked off.  All of the puzzles MUST be done in order.

Didn't feel like going through another few hundred or so to see if it got more interesting later.

I liked the concept behind the puzzles but they got really flat and samey very quickly.

Think I enjoyed it a bit more before I realized it's worth more points to go for perfect streaks than to collect all the coins.  Even though there isn't much meaning in going for a higher score.",0,1648007672,133,0,36

3602,1481000,"Triversal is a super satisfying puzzle experience.  The music, visuals, and fx draw you in.  It reminds me of Tetris Effect, taking a uniquely simple yet complex puzzle idea and doing it in this chilled out style.  

You can just zone out playing this game, but the puzzles are still naturally satisfying to solve because of how they are designed.  They have a great tie to what I would consider real world physics so solving them is super satisfying because you kind of have an innate knowledge of what might and might not work as soon as a puzzle is presented to you.  Triversal ties into our seemingly uniquely human love to classify and explain numerical and angle phenomenon throughout our physical reality using mathematics, physics, and science. I view these elements as constructs we developed to make sense of the universe essentially.  I think it is a uniquely satisfying puzzle game because it ties in so heavily to that sort of built in knowledge but still presents a challenge to solve.  

They also have a cool mechanic where you collect coins as you solve the puzzles so it becomes a challenge of collecting all the coins while still solving the puzzle in as few moves as possible.  All these elements really work well together and create an awesome, immersive experience that you can just get lost in.",1,1650568535,805,0,42
3603,1481000,"Before the official launch, I watched Phantom Compass' live stream where they dove into the Stream Assist mechanic. This is a really handy feature that can help streamers engage with their audiences. Interactive with chat and playing a game at the same time can be cumbersome, so playing a game like Triversal can really help you get the best of both worlds, interaction AND engagement. The overall gameplay is relaxing and enjoyable, but still requires plenty of attention (especially if you want to get all of those sweet sweet coins!). I'm a sucker for a good neon aesthetic, and Triversal has that in spades. Also, this game feels specifically designed to succeed on mobile, so hopefully we get a port soon! Great work",1,1644612606,21,0,1
3604,1481000,"A fun little puzzle game, simple to understand and a lovely clean interface.  Click on up to three tether points to suspend your glow ball over the black hole.  Most levels are fairly straightforward, but then you hit one that stumps you for a few minutes as you try one combination after another.

I try to do the daily puzzle every morning, then one of the packs later in the day, and if I have some time on my hands there are the endurance modes for (potentially) infinite play.

There's a free demo available to try before you pay, so why not give it a go?

Edit: May 2024

The game has had a significant update a month or so ago, which has considerably increased the complexity of the puzzles.  For me, that's made it less fun - your mileage will vary.  Honestly, I would have preferred it if the new version had been released as a separate game - I would have bought it, tried it and probably decided I preferred the original and stuck to playing that.  As it is, I can't go back to the old version, and I've basically stopped playing.  I still recommend that you try it out though and see if it suits you.",1,1633624534,5131,0,34

3606,1481000,"Very clever fun game. A unique idea that I have never seen implemented before, or even imagined. I got that same feeling playing this as I did when I first played Portal, the two games are very dissimilar, mind you, but the feeling of never having played anything like this before is what links them. If you like puzzle games that challenge you but are not overly complex in understanding how to play, you really should give this a try and it is at a very attractive price too.",1,1627169580,397,0,8

**SPOILERS FOR EVERY ROUTES**
Koujaku's route is definitely my favorite. It was really cute and I like how their relationship progresses (pretty sure it was the longest out of all routes too). Noiz is my favorite man, I love his character development (good ending) and the ""bite it"" scene was really interesting. Clear's route is absolutely top 3 for me, very cute. Although it was sad, the ending totally made it all worth it (good ending). I'm not a big fan of Mink's route due to it having a lot of abuse, sa, and rape (if you don't like any of that, don't do his route). I personally like Virus & Trip as characters, so their ending wasn't all that bad to me. They take Aoba for themselves and (try to?) break him (they also have a 3some).
**MAJOR SPOILERS FOR REN'S ROUTE** 
For Ren's route, I find it very weird. Since Ren was technically a part of Aoba and they went ahead and did it, would it be considered selfcest? I can understand that Ren is a whole different person being at that time but I just can't understand why they let them pursue each other romantically. Especially for his good ending too, he gets transfer into Sei's body (literally Aoba's brother). I like how they can be with each other now and all (very cute) but I can't get past it with Ren being in Aoba's brother's body. I could say it was cute, but not my type of thing.",1,1721509406,2622,0,1

3687,1481111,"Likes: 
1. The Mask is really cool and fits well with Cold Blood.
2. The rest of the outfit has this very Mercenary/Black Ops feel that although the other armors also have, this one isn't nearly as outlandish or ugly to look at.
3. The hood on the top fits well with pretty much every other Insurgent face wear. I particularly like combining it with the Smooth Mask or the regular One hole/Two hole balaclava.
4. The goggles are very stylish, and come in both black and orange variants.
Dislikes:
1. When using heavy body armor, the lower half clips through the outfit.
2. You are more likely to be team killed wearing this than straight up staring down your own teammates gun barrels and hurling insults at them.
3. The set doesn't come with its own set of gloves, making it pretty awkward to walk around in tundra specific gear without any gloves to come with it.
4. The mask doesn't actually work as a gas mask sadly, you still wear the regular GP-5 gas mask over it, looks kinda ugly with the set on. 

I still recommend this set because buying these cosmetic sets support the devs. Hopefully future cosmetics will be a bit more consistent in their overall theme.",1,1607449728,0,0,27

This game gets you into it straight away, the intro is just enough to make you curious about the rest of the lore. The graphics are good as well. The item/inventory system works great as well and the battle system is easy to learn. 

The health mechanic makes you want to play  a bit too carefully though, thus the game difficulty is just average, not too hard and not too easy. You have different ""paths"" you can go trough, in the way of building your character.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]

Love Puzzle in its current state is not recommended.  You cannot complete the game and the same issue prevents you from replaying

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

You must move your square to capture a grey square.  You can only move in a straight line and you stop when you hit a wall.  The general idea is you have to figure out how to get your square to end up at the grey square to capture it.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]

There are eight animated girl images, since the 10th one is broken and has been since December 11, 2020.  The animation for most of them makes them look like they are floating in weightless space.  Some of the art (Girl Playing Piano) is used in some of their other titles.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]

I [b]DO NOT[/b] recommend this game until it is patched.  Given that it has been broken for four months I don't see that happening any time soon.

[h1]System Specs[/h1]

Intel i7-8086K Coffee Lake 6-Core 4.00GHz CPU
Crucial Ballistix Sport AT 2666 MHz DDR4 RAM (16GB x 2)
ASUS GeForce RTX 2080 Overclocked 8G GDDR6

3750,1480370,"This game is awful. 

Before buying, I watched the dev stream this game for around an hour. I don't think I have seen anyone this bad at playing any game let alone their own video game. He would play every level for at least 5 minutes, and is worse at them than he is in the trailer.

While watching, I noticed he misspelled the title in the title screen. I took a screenshot. https://ibb.co/3mdXYR3

I bought the game and confirmed that yes, he did actually manage to misspell the title in the game. I actually tried playing the game and it's a struggle. Every 2 or 3 levels you will get a cropped image of a vaguely lewd anime girl. It is not worth the effort for these pictures and the game sounds like MKultra mind control.

Overall, a very painful experience and I never want to go back.

[b]Love Puzzle[/b] is a lewd puzzle game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Guide an uncolored square to the goal using obstacles to guide its trajectory. The square can only move up-and-down or left-and-right; when moved, it will not stop until colliding with something else. The idea is to take advantage of the level layout until it [i]ultimately[/i] collides with the goal. The puzzles aren't very difficult; they can often be solved with guesswork. However, there were a few times I had to consider my actions. Every few levels you complete, you'll unlock another CG!

[h1]Story[/h1]
There is no story (and I'm not making one up!)

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen is clean and simplistic, but otherwise boring; I don't associate this aesthetic with [i]adult-games.[/i] Audio preferences can be adjusted from ""Settings"". Your personal records/statistics can be viewed from ""Score"", and unlocked CGs from ""Gallery"". The CGs fill the whole screen, but the user-interface cannot be hidden.

[h1]The Goods[/h1]
The base game contains no adult-content. It includes nine CGs -- some of them are animated, some are not. Each includes a close-up, clothed view of an anime waifu. These CGs are based on their lewd counterparts (with the [i]good stuff[/i] cropped out.)

[b]- DLC - Love Puzzle -[/b]
This (free) DLC animates and uncrops the base CGs. It also includes nine new sexual animations -- overall, DLC - Love Puzzle adds eighteen new animated CGs. The sexual animations are hit or miss. Although the artwork is high quality, the animation is somewhat sloppy. Many of the girls move as though they are being [banged], but there's nothing [banging] them. If I saw women acting the way they are in [b]Love Puzzle,[/b] I think I'd call 9-1-1! 

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Overall, [b]Love Puzzle[/b] is an [i]okay[/i] buy -- I've seen better art and gameplay at similar price points. There is meaningful gameplay, but most the ""puzzles"" are brain-dead easy. [b]Love Puzzle[/b] is an remarkable game, but I don't have much to complain about. I think users would appreciate a ""skip"" button, and the user-interface isn't as reactive as I'd like. If you're on the look-out for inexpensive, adult-animations [b]Love Puzzle[/b] is a decent buy. . . but I'd wait for a light sale.

3796,1480370,"I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1,1707323676,52,0,2640

Hypothetically, this would mean that with 10 girls, you would get a total of 2 scenes for each girl, based on the trailer video on the store page.  You don't because the unlock of girl #10 gets stuck, and you just get her scene 1 every time after level 20.

-  Cute Fashion and Neko girl
- Cute Animations

Cons:
- The tamagotchi system does not work.
- At 0 Hunger or Clean, it will not do anything. i.e make her sick or cause death.
- She will infinitely refuse to work cause she is in the bad mood (0 Hunger and 0 Clean). If you have no money, it will not go anywhere, as she does not die.
- Not sure if this is a bug, but if you switch off your computer while the classes are on going, it will not register the fact she did any classes at all. I did 2 hours of one of the classes and it still showed 0 on the stat board. This might be a thing with jobs too but I need to confirm.

Overall I do not recommend this game. This same developer has another Neko game without the tamagotchi aspect. Its cheaper. I'd get that instead, because as long as this tamagotchi stays broken, its a waste of money.

3868,1480480,"This comment maybe more subjective than objective point of view but that doesn't matter
It looks like there have been few comments at the time i write comments in English so i am gladly to be one of them.

A next generation from the old software DME (desktop magic engine) with the name desktopMMD3 in order to boost sales, it will not be a big deal but since the advertise mentioned about brand new rendering engine and no skirt clipping, many have expected the improvement in the physical movement but until now there is nothing change for the any PME format style models. If it only about this particular model named Miss Fish then this software clearly already achieved its goal but unfortunately for most anime fan this put them in nothing more than disappointment and resentment about this software (maybe only me). 

Just like its former generation DME (or DMMD2 however you refer it) there are only few changes compared to the old ones. I don't know about the others but personally when i launch my own model it looks somewhat weird and bizarre, it gives me chill to my spinal core whenever i see my beloved one doesn't even look like any MMD in the youtube. Her eyes become even bigger than the usual and whenever her eyes blink I notices her entire also blink too, this doesnt affect much on Miss Fish and yet the difference become more distinct when you used different models.

Overall, I believe this one like DME should labeled as EARLY ACCESS in order to not mislead people but whatever. This software is borrowing the positive review from the old ones for getting more sales but in reality the developers just sell it under another name to satisfy their greed. Despite of having several months there is still no significant improvement in physical collision. The previous version DesktopMMD1 (version 1.6 or 1.7) really manage good physical rendering effect and compared to the current version DMM2 and DMM3 are no matched in how they render model's movement. 

What a great disappointment

3869,1480480,"I'm going to be brutally real with y'all, and be more ""informative"" than my other Steam reviews.

This should [i]not[/i] have been a separate product. It should've been an update to something previous. I've seen the developer state that it's a major update, and that's why it's a separate application. To me, that's not entirely valid. Making this an update with a [i]price increase[/i] would've been the better choice in my opinion.

As an example, I bought Marmoset Hexels 3 when it was Marmoset Hexels 2. It had an update and a price increase for [i]future purchases[/i]. I did not have to spend money for this upgrade, and I still genuinely like the program and how they made it. The only disadvantage to this is that people can't buy the older version, but at this point it would've been an older, unsupported version of the fundamentally same program.

I feel like this is would've been a smarter action to take for these series of programs. I feel like Desktop Magic Engine (fundamentally Desktop MMD 2) could've just gotten an update like this program. They share a very similar interface, and it's painfully obvious to me that these are more or less ""copy-and-paste"" programs, with more shiny features to make purchasing sound more reasonable.

I understand the existence of DME (DMMD 2) as the first DMMD was taken off of Steam for a module that was originally released under no license and given a license to revoke usage for commercial purposes (by the way, this is completely reasonable to do and doesn't violate anything) and the developer of the module complained to Valve. So a re-release without that exact module (or the same module if a settlement was made for use with or without compensation) makes sense. However, I don't fully agree with how the developer handled it. For a re-release, giving out a free key is something other developers do but admittedly not all. One example is when Klei Entertainment remastered [i]Mark of the Ninja[/i]. They initially gave owners of the original game a free copy of the remaster, but I didn't notice until I came across it (I assume that I missed an announcement, I'm not sure.)

In my opinion, this could have been handled a lot better. I don't agree with the developer's rebuttal of this on other reviews, and it seems like that it's something cookie-cutter. You could've handled this better, mate.",0,1616886410,10,0,1019
3870,1480480,"During the Cyber Monday Sale!  I got both DesktopMMD3:Miss Fish VS Desktop Kanojo.  I am giving both games a Thumbs Up, but in the end.  I prefer Desktop Kanojo over DesktopMMD3: Miss Fish.  Here is why!


Starter Girl:
Fish is a younger game.  Perhaps that attributes to it's less then stellar graphics.  Even for a MMD model.  The starter model is far to plastic and lifeless.  It's facial expressions are more like facial ticks.  Body wise, is not bad.  But not smooth.  You can see it a lot in the finger.

Kanojo is close to a year older, yet your starting girl is a lost smoother and more realistic.  Not nearly as plastic.  Closer to a soft porcelain doll.  You don't see nearly (or any most time) joint wrinkling or collapsing.  Like the wrist is caving in.  That is not happening.

Animations and Poses:
Fish does not come with many animation and poses.  Not as many as Kanojo.  I get it.  Fish is styled to dance more then pose.  Which is ok, but a larger variety would be nice.

Kanojo has about 3 times more poses and animation from the start.  Not as many dances but for me.  I just like having a nice little model stand there and be cute then dancing all over my screen.  I am not watching a MMD video.  I am just want someone to keep me company while I do stuff.


Voice, Music, Sound:
Fish wins when it comes to sound variety as it seems to be designed more as a music player for you dancing model.  There are some voice comments, but all in Japanese (i think).  The music works great with the dancing.

Kanojo has two sets of voiced phrases to be spoken when doing animations.  Sadly they are in Chinese and Japanese.  So, unless you understand what she is saying.  It's kinda wasted without some kind of subtitle.  There also no music from the start.  But, if want music.  I just load up Pandora and bam.  J-Pop for days.


System Controls:
Fish is annoying with the controls.  Not very user friendly.  You can move her from side to side and zoom in, but you can't really turn her or tilt her around with out going into the control settings.  Even when you do that.  She resets back to front standing when she does an animation.  It's rather annoying and makes it less enjoyable.  Also no timer to be set between her animations.  The only thing I like is you can right click her and she does a cute animation to bring up controls. 

Kanojo is fairly user friendly.  She has all the same standard controls as Fish but also, you can rotate her and tilt her.  She won't reset if she does a new animation.  You can set time limit between animation.  She has an alarm feature as well.  Nice if you want to know when it's time to do something else or such.  Solid controls.


Workshop:
Fish has a bigger workshop.  Ok, so there is a far larger workshop for fish then there is for Kanojo.  Which is amazing while sad at the same time.  I subscribed to a lot of models.  A large variety.  Sadly, most of what I was finding was just a plastic and outdated as Fish.  There were some really nice models, though there seemed to be a lot of duplicate and/or ""I'm Naked"" models.  Which I do like my nudity, if it's nice to look at.  These, really were not.  Most everything is tied very much to MMD model style, but older.  Some very nice Rin models and a Cute Lapis (Steven Universe), but just not the quality I was hoping for.  Larger sound library though (music).  Animation though... nothing really.


Kanojo has some very nice workshop models.  About 1/10 as much as Fish, but more quality.  Just like Fish.  I subscribed to a lot to see what they had.  Many I did not like, was not cause of quality.  Just not my style.  They looked good, but not for me.  The variety is there.  A great Mona (Genshin) and wonderfully tasteful NSFW Miku.  They also have this absolutely adorable Raymond (animal crossing).  Again, many styles to meet a larger fan base of taste.  Just, not as much.  Sadly.


CLOSING:
In the end I find Kanojo much more enjoyable over Fish.  I give this game a thumbs up cause even though it's not as good.  It does the job and thanks to the workshop.  Has something work looking at.  If they can change there controls to be easier to use and functional that will probably make them the better Desktop.  The fans in the workshop will add the rest, if they stay.  I will watch this myself in hopes it gets better while using Kanojo mostly cause of the current quality it has over Fish.

1.Higher frame rates at least up to 144 fps 60 fps is just a bit choppy for me in today's age.
2.Another tab in the programs interface for adult or 18+ content it is quite annoying when searching for something and have a screen full of nudes inbetween.
3.Some more movement during idling on my desktop maybe sit down cook something or play a board game wit ha little chair or whatever something creative then just checking her shoes from all angles every 5 seconds.
4.i know this one is always a struggle and is not of too high importance but if possible to remove the clipping into eachother of body parts and clothes.

For 3.99? Seriously? This thing cost less than a cheesburger =/. You get decent 3d Models with great movement ( though weird movement at times) and multiple Models. Be it for general purpose use or the NSFW aspect 3.99 is fine.

They say its been abandoned... honestly I don't know if it has. I got it like a few months ago and barely use it.

But... as of this review... it's only $3.99... and its not on sale. =/ To me that sound like the devs want to do more but can't and know the audience would not be happy if they where asking for like $10-$15 to fund them.

Take a dive into the community's content, and if you like what you see and have the money to spare go ahead, just keep in mind you can't have your waifu dance to 'Billie Jean' unless someone does all the animation job for that specific track and uploads it for you to use in here.

 It also requieres specific players for the job, so unless you use Spotify, CloudMusic, QQMusic, Winamp, Foobar2000, Kugou, XiaMi or VLC (and chances are, you do) you won't have her dance to your favorite music unless you use the included player... and even then the model doesn't do a good job for anything that hasn't been preanimated by the comunity since it plays whatever random dance it has on it's database and stick to it for the full song without caring for rythm or anything; [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198182792918/recommended/1480480?tscn=1643761998]this[/url] does a better job on that regard.",0,1619605800,658,0,84

They randomly play out the movements when idle. It is quite fun to watch.
Then there are hundreds of songs to subscribe, many comes with motions that match the songs perfectly. Every model can dance to those songs, even the robots. It is quite a fun and hilarious experience to watch a pretty girl dance with a robot.
Overall I think this piece of software can worth much much more. I am glad that it only cost me $4.

3957,1480520,"1 Hour Impression:
And something of a tl;dr at the end

Faye/Sleepwalker is a 3D Open World RPG with a Hack n Slash fighting style designed through Unity, and it shows.

So 1st off.. the Graphics.
The graphics of this game are certainly not the best. It looks like Unity's version of Breath of the Wild, but a little rougher around the edges. After completing the Tutorial and being sent to the main world of the game I had to go into my settings and turn Bloom off, because the entire map seemed to practically be glowing. The grass is patchy, and the terrain is a little strange looking at times. Certain NPCs look a little.. off. 
But all this said, there's something about it that I absolutely adore. While at times, the assets for this 3D Unity game can appear absolutely abysmal, the world is well designed. Large mountains, a firm layout for towns that works for the fantasy-style world the developers aimed for, and an odd attention to small details in the oddest of places

The Music.
Not really much to say. The soundtrack doesn't appear to be a very large one, but the music is actually really nice to listen to. It sets a good tone for the game and the character. A comforting constant piano medley will follow you regardless of where you go. Wish there was more to it though.

The gameplay.
This. This is where the game goes from being some sub-par indie project to being an actual well-oiled machine of a game. It's simple, and reminiscent of any Hack and Slash game you might have played in the past. Pressing X and Y consistently to do an absolute brutal combo attack on the enemies you face. But yet. There's more than that. Enemies are not merely some 2 hit kill, even after hitting level 12. It takes time. You can play it safe, and it will take longer, or you can dare to get hurt or die, and activate sleepwalk mode. This basically makes you more powerful, but at the risk of taking far more damage. For whatever reason, this works. And you'll find yourself using this a lot. And for less hardcore players, this means that you'll have to find a good midpoint between using sleepwalk mode and keeping your health high. 
While the game is not Souls-like in difficulty, it still faces its own series of challenges. And it really helps the game to shine where it matters

You can also use Memory Points, gathered from defeating enemies, to gain new abilities and become stronger at your own pace. One of the most unique things I think I may have ever seen come out of a game is using something like this as a means to explain why, at the beginning, you can not see enemy health. You have to actually earn it.

Other aspects.
The game features a Day/night cycle that some features of the game, including upgrades, actually rely on. It's most certainly a nice touch to a decent game. You can talk to some of the NPCs, not all, but it seems that most don't offer much in terms of dialogue, despite the game encouraging you to talk to them frequently. The English... is mostly decent. There's some clear translation issues, but nothing that really looks like they ripped it out of Google Translate, fortunately, and you will be able to understand the story, tips, and NPCs fairly easily. 

Some of the bugs I've faced are odd though. Getting stuck on top of enemies, which usually was fixed by simply using the Dash button, watching NPCs basically glide-walk on their preset routes, some minor clipping through the walls, and a bit too much of this ""slow motion"" effect for my liking. But nothing major. 

There's more to it but I've really dragged this on quite a bit.

Tl;dr
In it's current stages I wouldn't say the game is worth the $18 I paid. It's a great game, despite needing some graphical touch ups more than anything, but it's also definitely a game that sometimes, feels a little empty, and should definitely be considered ""Early Access"" for the time being. Will I keep playing it? Definitely. It's fun enough that I will definitely want to see where the story brings me and I want to see everything the game still has left to offer me. 

Graphics: 6/10
Music: 4/10 (Isnt bad but.. Need more sountracks :/ )
Combat: 8.5/10
World design: 6.5/10 (still a little empty in places)

3960,1480520,"Great game made with a lot of heart. The story, music, voice acting, graphics, combat system, everything is good.
It may look a bit primitive at times... simple models, noticeable loading of areas, in boss fights camera moves in the best tradition of Souls-like games, but the overall effect is stunning. Very touching, this game has the same spirit as Yoko Taro's Nier series. Such a brilliant work for a small team.",1,1697493188,584,0,170
3961,1480520,"It is a pretty smooth game, and has wide environments that are just fun to explore. These environments are also detailed pretty well for a small project. It has more of a somber feel. so the story comes off pretty deep. It is engaging to say, and gets ya thinking. The combat is also very fun, it just needs some slight tweaks to make it a bit more smooth. Though, it is not an issue. This game clearly has a lot of passion in it. It has a skill tree, quests, etc. The main focus though, is on Faye's journey.

I just find myself getting deeper into the game, and having fun while doing so. The soundtracks are also pretty good. The voice acting is excellent as well. It also has an interesting sleepwalk mode which really brings out the excitement but at a cost no less.

All in all, just a good game for what it is.

Updated Review:

As I got further into the game, it naturally expands. While also maintaining a somber mood. The story is about a nameless person, who goes under the name of Faye. With reason from the prologue. There are a few maps, but what is there can keep you playing for hours as things steadily expand. The soundtrack. the fast battle system. The pretty descent skill tree, wide environment, etc. It was done quite well for a small project. If there is anything that could be done better, was to make the combat a bit more smooth. As it can be hard to target at times, and make things slightly faster to make it more fluid.

Though, these are minor problems in comparison to everything else. It has fun boss battles, a good amount of quests. However, I'd say the sticking point is the interesting story. Which might I add has great voice acting.

Last Update:

Now that I finished the game, I have to say, it is simply amazing. Think of it more of trying to claim one's own existence. The methods from some can be harsh, others can understand, but not approve. Faye's story is about learning about her existence, in a deeply emotional story. There is a decent amount of lore, and while there is room for expansion. What is there was phenomenal. The battle system as well, the longer you play, the better you become. It takes a bit of practice to learn. Though, once it is down, the game is very exciting. Packed in with a deep story, it was one of the better games I played. 

If there is ever another game, I'd be willing to play it. I recommend checking out this one.",1,1694283769,394,0,57

In combat you switch between normal and ""sleepwalker"" mode, the latter being a state where you deal more damage but also take more. There's also dozens of abilities and passives on a board that you can unlock with skill points.",1,1652752112,258,0,213
3964,1480540,"'FICTION #F3F' is a small collection of 5 visual experiences from the developer of 'O.N.O.W'. I'll be honest, some of these are not that great, but after discovering a few things to do in the last 2 games, I feel better about the overall package, considering that you can explore the first 3 games in about 20 minutes. The NightLine is the only one I genuinely don't like, as far as I can tell you are stuck on the train watching the city, and the visuals are not particularly interesting. I don't mind being locked in one place, but even ONOW had a better-looking metropolis that you could navigate, so I am not sure what escapism I should get out of Nightline. 'That Feeling Blue' has a nice aesthetic and it's fun to explore for 5 minutes, so it's kinda hard to feel strongly one way or another. 'Carcavas' is similar in that regard, it has creative visuals and a small area to explore, but ultimately it does not have much to offer beyond 15 minutes. 'ae' is my second favorite game in this collection, it's also the second-longest game offering about 20 minutes of free exploration with various routes and psychedelic vibes (make sure you replay it because it has a few hidden trinkets). 

Well, let's talk about The Sands of Voltark which is a large desert with sandworms (I prefer to call it DUNE, hell even the ship design looks familiar). Like the previous 3 games, it's a walking simulator but with a much bigger area to explore, additionally to having multiple endings, and arguably better aesthetic & soundtrack. I was initially confused because I tried to click on a button, but the hotspot was too small so I wasted like 60 minutes traveling across the desert. If you know what you doing, you can probably cover the map and its multiple endings in 60 minutes. The visuals for this one are pretty cool, there are many huge structures and the world seems to change based on how many pylons you activate. You can end the game immediately, but make sure you explore the map because there are other endings as I mentioned. 

[i] I personally enjoy having game packs, reminds me of demo CDs from the good old days, maybe I just got a little tilted because the NightLine was the first one that I played. Some of these games feel like a missed opportunity,  they are fine, but you could do more with them. [/i]

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

+ well there are 5 games, I liked 2, and 2 more were okey 
+ most of these have nice atmosphere & mood
+ the last game has decent amount of exploration and multiple endings

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

Not much to say in terms of criticism, not that I don't have it, the games are just too basic for me to nitpick them, I got what I paid for, although I expected more from the ONOW dev.

[b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]

I considered posting a negative review just because you have to pay $5 for these, but the ideas are not bad, they are just very small games. Again, not against the idea of game packs, maybe not the best selection. If you never played ONOW and want to try something like that, it has a lot more content. I am still looking forward to 'Ode to A Moon'.

Of all 6 games here, none of them truly standout as anything special, and they all kind off fall into the category of ""Interesting ideas, with underwhelming execution."" Which is a shame because I do like some of the visuals and I think some of the ideas could be really cool experiences if they were more fleshed out. I don't think it's necessarily bad, but I also don't think anything in here is really worthwhile. It's hard to fully say where I'd rate it because I knew it was gonna be a bit out there, and Im okay with that. But it's still firmly in the ""Not good"" side of the spectrum.

Essentially I just played every scenario once and tried to find out if there was a switch in any of them. Besides that I mostly just walked around the scenarios and just observed.

What the game succeed in was basically make me feel things. Awe, anxiousness and ire mainly. The thing is that you probably won't feel the same way I did because it will depend on how you go into it. Depending on your life experiences, your mood or if you are hungry you will feel something else and that is why I can't directly recommend the game but I would like for people to try it out.

For example: the environment would react to your presence in That Feeling Blue, or you could pick stuff up in Nightline and throw it around. But that's just me.

Otherwise I really enjoyed these, they're chill, have great ambient tracks and visuals, and are good to come back to when I need some peace of mind. My absolute recommendation if you're into this kind of stuff.

3983,1480540,"This is first and foremost a walking sim.  I played through the first of the multiple stories, The Sands Of Voltark, and when I first tried it on the Steam Deck, it didn't work right.  I'm sure if I tweak the controls I can get it to work.  On my PC, I can play it using an Xbox controller so it should be workable on the Deck.  Anyway. When I got into Sands Of Voltark, it brought up a sort of confusing instruction screen telling me to travel to various beacons and activate them by hitting 5 buttons.  I didn't know if they were buttons on my keyboard/gamepad, but when I first started, I walked around, saw my ship, entered it, and game over, ending with credits, and I am back to selecting another of the multiple stories.  I tried Voltark again, and figured it out.  I activated beacon after beacon, then headed back to my ship, entered it, and... same ending as if I didn't activate the beacons.  So this is an EXTREMELY casual game from what I can see.  I'm not complaining, it's a great atmospheric walking sim.  for the price on sale (I paid $1.39 and that's with my state tax) I like it!  I have more stories to play through.  I do like walking sims.  Voltark made me feel like I was one of the first people to land on Mars and I had a job of helping to set the planet up to be suitable for human life.  The graphics along with the music is a great combo.  I was pleasantly distracted from real life.  What more can you ask for for less then $2.00?  If the developers are reading this, let me say I think your team can do more than this with what you've put into this particular story.

Question for the devs from a fan: Is there a deeper meaning to The Sands of Voltark? I ran around in it for like 7 hours trying to find everything I could, but I still don't get it, or even if there is an 'it' to get. My guess is it has to do with diverting the expectation of a grand space-faring spectacle by making the game so slow paced and by giving minimal actual story, but in a weird way there's a decent amount of stuff to find, so it's not exactly a pure subversion of that expectation.

4024,1479810,"Boy the other reviewers weren't kidding. The difficulty ramps up suddenly and viciously a third of the way into the first act, and stays arbitrarily high. The only tool you really have to remedy this is to drop the game's difficulty slider down onto tiny baby mode, as there's no consequences for doing this and as you can't grind for progression---you get advancement points from clearing stages and from clearing challenge quests, nothing else.

Equipment is also on random drop, and you have to go several levels at a time ignoring it until it gives you the effects you need for your build. Your can sell your surplus for money, but the amount is insultingly small, as is the money awarded randomly by enemy kills during stages. You need money to customize your buildings, and in general the game seems to expect you to have way more than you do at any given time.

However, if you look past this, you get a pretty paper-flat plot and an art style that looks great, but feels like it's maybe trying to ride on Hades' coattails.

So, why I am I still recommending it? If you get past all of these other things, there's a fun idea in here. Turret shooter / moba / td / rpg, all in one package. The enemy types are interesting, and the variety of upgrade paths and build styles is interesting---although the game doesn't let you experiment too much here, you need Leadership and you need Witches, and everything else is circumstantial.

The game also has some absolutely daunting tool tips that it throws at you, including a reminder to fully build up one column at a time before moving on to the next. This sounds insane to anyone who's played anything else in the genre, but no, the game means it. Unless you have hoplites in the front and healers in the back and a bard to buff their action speeds, that column is going to fold the second a train of enemies hits it, and then you're down all the points you invested in it and need to reset the stage.

OR.

Or you could switch to tiny baby easy mode, steamroll through stages, collect all the upgrades you need, and then play it on normal.

It really feels like a roguelike meta progression system is missing, or a way to grind, or a way to upgrade existing equipment instead of relying on the dice, or *something* to compensate for the game's wild difficulty spike.

Pre-spike, it's a lot of fun, and once you start playing the one way the game will allow you to play post-spike it's fine too, but I can see a lot of people bouncing off this one and you're not wrong if you do.

Edit: So, a weird quirk of the design is that there's these pauses between waves that you can't fast forward through. In fact, you can call waves early, but ONLY at a specific time---basically whenever the current wave was done. So there's awkward stretches of levels where there's nothing on the board and you're just waiting. They're more common early on during the normal difficulty levels, but they persist into the mid game. It's strange to see a td have this problem, since ""let the player fast forward"" is tech that's almost as old as the genre, but I think they built the pauses here to ensure you could regenerate stamina at specific times and, uh, not every player is going to need to regen stamina at the exact same time during levels.

2nd Edit: The translation is a little rough in places, and unfortunately those places are pretty impactful. It's not always super clear what a challenge mission is asking me to do, or what an ability does, etc. And this wouldn't be a problem, but sometimes it interferes with collecting (scarce, necessary) stat points.

3rd Edit: Also can we take a minute to talk about how the challenge criteria are often obnoxious? ""Win without using any legendary equipment,"" ""win with less than 15 stat points allocated,"" ""win without using x/y/z powers"". Stuff that requires you to shuffle around your build and/or hope for drops. ""Don't let any enemies leak,"" is normal, reasonable, and it's a challenge criteria only occasionally here. A lot of the other criteria are these weird build contortions.

4th Edit: Here's a boss that requires you to jankily active parry an awkward hitbox several times in a row. Why yes, this is a tower defense.

5th Edit: Yeah. Switching to a thumbs down. The art and the music are nice, but ultimately the scaling building costs force you to invest in leadership, which means you need to do the tedious challenge quests. The design wants you to rush full upgrades in one building type before moving on to the next (a tooltip tells you this!) but the costs are so wildly inflated that you have to grind tiny amounts of gold to attempt this, and even if you succeed if you level the thing over what your leadership can manage you've messed up. And this would all be minor if your equipment wasn't random drop, meaning it's a coin toss whether you have anything useable at your current level, or you're stuck with viable gear from 10+ levels back. Which wouldn't even be a problem if grinding was fun, but the bizarre intermittent pauses in waves and the lack of fast forward or an actual button that lets you actually call the wave early, not whatever arbitrary window the designers decided meant early, means it sucks to replay anything in this game. It sucks worse than it sucks to play a Legendary Hoplite stage for the first time. I hate to be like ""just design the game good, and then it won't be bad"" but Legendary Hoplite walks shins-first into some of the weirdest stumbling blocks imaginable. There's good ideas in here, but they're engulfed in baffling design.",0,1719589665,353,0,352

4032,1479850,"This game is pretty much a fun and chaotic multiplayer Pac Man.

Edit: The one con I had for this game (revolving around a bug preventing multiple keyboard players from joining) has been completely removed thanks to the new update!

Pros:

It's a really fun improvement to the original version, with a lot of additional modes such as Zone Dash that actually end up being more fun than the original modes instead of being filler content.

This is definitely the best version of this title without a doubt, so if you are interested in a fun chaotic local multiplayer game to play with some friends - its actually a pretty good option for any age group (even if it initially may appear to be just for kids).

While it may seem like a shallow game at first glance, once you get a few matches in you'll finally experience the exhilarating fun of narrowly escaping and outsmarting your friends with your reflexes and power ups.

Cons:

[strike] When it comes to cons, the only issue I have been currently facing is getting the keyboard player to actually join the match (the keyboard player only seems to be able to join when the game is set to one player) - I'll update this review if I figure it out or if it ends up being fixed.

The power-ups add an extra element of madness which is most enjoyed when playing with others. 

Playing against the computer is also enjoyable, particularly the Cake Race. It brings the focus, not just to the other 'players', but to the whole level. Where, in multiplayer mode, the distraction is the people in the room, in Cake Race the distraction is cake. Cake is a good distraction.... always.

4036,1479850,"We have played Chompy Chomp Chomp at gatherings with family and friends so much. We own it on all of the platforms! It's a great game to get non-gamers involved in a games night. We've played with people as young as 3 and as old as 83! It's a great addition to any games night line up. Everyone has their own favourite mode, and everyone has a really fair chance of winning. Because it is colourful, appealing, fun, simple it has become a family favourite. We like to play with around 5 players as it gets to be quite chaotic with 8 but you can play around with the settings a lot and really change how the game plays to accommodate a lot.

Specifically on PC: If there aren't many of you, it's best played with controllers rather than keyboard, although it's quite cool that if you want to cram around you can still play. If you do play with keyboard you need to go to the settings to switch the menus to show the keyboard icons otherwise it's a bit confusing. It's definitely worth checking how the controls are set up when you use a controller too, we had a controller that caused the game to pause when you clicked on the joystick which kept happening by accident.

Maps: Fun and funky, we randomly kept changing them and each one seemed to have a unique thang. We haven't done the DLC yet but there seemed enough to keep you going through several evenings without repeating much.

Gameplay: Smooth. And really with an arcader multi-player split screener that's what counts. I don't know what it was built on but that engine deserves a gold star, along with the developers.

Complexity: I think this would be fine to play with very little gamers. We didn't and included some firey drinking penalties into the podium placings. A little fiddling with the options revealed that we weren't really playing like pros. There's a LOT more to using the items than we got our heads around.

Summary: At this price get it in prep for Xmas holiday parties, get good and enjoy the few minutes of unadulterated joy in domination before your cohorts gang up against you and steal your precious crown!

Highly recommended for the fans, but get it when it's on sale.

I've only played 1 match for 4 minutes- if that. Killer insta-killed everyone and then logged off. The rest of my time was waiting for players to even be online which never happened.

For the Dev:
From my brief run through ONE match I can tell you: controls are clunky, animations are terrible, sounds are cheap, and the objectives for winning and losing are not fully presented. This makes for terribly awkward gameplay, and that's not what you're looking to present to players as a first impression. You want something a lot more polished than this to be presented.

For potential buyers:
If you're getting this game thinking you're going to be playing an 4survivors vs 1killer game, you're wrong. You're buying a early access dead game that you can't even play because nobody is ever on.

Then the few times I actually got to play a game, the killers just camp a downed person and kill you pretty instantly. Other than having an actual ""scary"" feel to the game, I think it's pretty bad.

- if you play cathedral . as survivor you have to break rocks and collect gems to get the key . survivors can trap the killer or monsters . if you healed someone or you break any rocks  you gonna get money this money you can buy heal or power to stun the killer.

[b] What I like: [/b]
- The developers are constantly taking in suggestions and keeping us updated in the Discord. 
- The atmosphere of the game is really nice! I'm excited to see the new maps that will be added soon.
- The game is unique enough to not be a Dead by Daylight copy. People will always associate asymmetric horror with DBD but it's not.

[b] Complaints: [/b]
- The killer is still pretty strong but they're working with the community to make it feel more balanced. 
- Theirs not many people playing but it's in beta. Also, the community is really nice so far.
- I wish there was a tutorial for new players because it can be a bit overwhelming at first but you catch on pretty quickly.

[b] Overall: [/b]

Relaxing and funny game where you just need to find 100 hidden eternalss. Once you find them all, you just completed the whole game. Sounds easy right? Some eternals are really tough to find but you will figure it out. If you can´t find some of them there is hint system that will help you. Art and music fits together nicely. Also moving elements adds an extra touch to it.

Overall it is a good game to decompress. If you have good eyes for seeking it will take you about 15 minutes to 30 minutes at maximum. Also you will get easily 100 achievements. GL & HF.

however i didnt play very far, the game is just not polished enough. 2 seconds into the game and the first bug came up:
if you walk too fast out of the room then first quest doesnt even start. 

then there too many ghost doors and people. you can walk through them like they are not even there. or characters stand on walls inside some houses. 

also the key binding is very confusing and there is no way to rebind it or even check what keys you need to press. it seems to be some combination of mouse and keyboard. at least i couldnt exit the menue with the keyboard alone.

another point is the games art. parts of it look nice and unique other parts look downride terrible.

the bottom line is i cant recommend the game for the current 20 bucks. 
it just doesnt feel like a finished product yet. for that it needs a LOT of testing and polishment.

well worth getting if you have completed the others.

i will say though,
2 bugs have been noticed so far and i think the devs are aware of it.i fully expect these to be rectified in a patch,hopefully soon.
the train stuck unloading at certain platforms bug,seems to be station related is the most painful.
i've put my Japan scenario on hold until this is fixed,you can play around it but its time consuming.

the other bug appears in all the other DLC's and base but appears to be more noticable in Japan.
it sometimes doesnt let a switch track/crossover point at the station exit line up correctly and will screw up with either a bit of track going missing or the switch being unable to place where otherwise it should.
this bug is only minor and with patience can be worked around,but still a tad time consuming and annoying.

One new addition to game play in the scenarios is adjusting the ticket prices to make it more affordable to the common people, which also boosts passengers. The first scenario is pretty straightforward and while it makes you work it doesn't present insurmountable problems. The second scenario on Southern Japan is quite epic in comparison and is further complicated in that you have to build up towns and lines while the area still belongs to a competitor, making for some really challenging routes.

4164,1479630,"Yes I would.... but there are a few ""buts"". Yet bare in mind this is just a single plkayers experience.

The 1 st. chapter in USA was enjoyable, scenery looked great and seemed to be no stress being able to learn the ropes.
Yet then the .... hits the fan and you move into 2nd. chapter. For me it did not take long to realise that I was having to skip all the enjoyment of planning and crossing barriers for a battle against competitors. Yet I would not have minded, but the years seem to flash by. yes, you can dial down the progress speed and even remove competitors completely, yet then the game becomes dry! After watching the LIVE or recorded feed of your tester playing, it only confirmed what I hate most about having too much stress in gamplay. It´s not what most pay for and the nirative and script was all about advancing as quickly as you could, no time for many of the quests and you end up bodging the functionality of your efforts.


(SPOILER):  Japan was a huge let down, nothing like the American map in variety of detail. a flat green lawn with very badly done cheert trees, no odd detail in the tiny hills and North Japan was all the same. would love to be able to show a shot of the paddy feilds, a 2 cm thick blob with the cut areas of water with very rough borders. No, I now fear that maybe France is going to be similar. At least their will be a Mount Fugi somewhere to see.
I´m a graphic designer or was, yet what pulls me into a game like this is the quality of the follow up material. You could have done a better Japan? It´s also tiny in size with barely any room for anything.

Will say that the scenery look very cool on America though ok. Yet Japan only looked good with a glance over my shoulder 3 meters away from the screen on my way out to get another tea!
Their is still a little arcade feeling to the UI and thats ok, yet it is a little too childish in others, like the charictors.
Still hopefully they will make changes, like being able to opt out of the difficult points haltway through a game?

Many thx for your efforts, yet you should at least promote the game with a tester who can both talk about the game and know what his doing, or maybe it was because he had to work soo hard to manage in the time given?!!",1,1667841098,0,0,68

POSITIVES:
Level Design
Mechanic Functionality
Art

NEGATIVES:
Some mechanics seem to be used just for the sake of it being used. 
Mechanics, whilst cool, feel unpolished. 
Level transitions

Comments: 

Props to the level designer, mechanics were utilised in an interesting way - although I found that the ball-on-button mechanic seemed to be used frequently just for the sake of it - what is the point of the ball spawning right next to the button at the end of some of the stages? It just seems like an unnecessary step to opening the portal to the next level.

Jumping off the walls is inconsistent, and feels even more strange given that you can give yourself a lot of height, but not a lot of forward velocity. Also a little buggy, in certain cases I would rotate around the walls when attached to them.

Needs a cross hair - launching the ball forwards is good, but if you just miss a jump it's a bit hard to replicate the velocity without a cross hair. 

A few jarring transitions - mainly just when loading levels and restarting the stage (though I can understand this if just for the sake of getting the player back into the action without a pause). 

Could use some music.

The sheer amount of achievements is also not needed, getting one every time I finish a stage takes the ""achieve"" away from them. 
Great performance, not a demanding game at all. 

Overall, concept is cool and is fine for a first game, though the mechanic inconsistency made me want to stop playing as it felt like I was just repeatedly yeeting balls at the wall until I got lucky and got it in just the right spot. If these are fixed, then I may return to finish.",0,1608994506,257,0,9

The puzzles start really simple for you to learn the mechanics and get harder with every level. There are also new mechanics and new types of levels interduced in the course of the game. This really keeps you interested since the game is constantly being developed further and new levels get released regularly.

Even though sometimes bugs do still appear in the game the devs are always happy to hear feedback and work with the community to improve it. I recommend joining the discord :)

4193,1479310,"Cute and artfully written, a relatively promising start for a story.


In the opening introduction to the narrative the writing's strength is very evident. It does well to balance artistic description with plain description, being neither too simple or pompous. The backgrounds and talksprites are well drawn, the music decently fitting. It establishes a relatively consistent immersion to the world. Although, to me, it looks like the arms and hands of the talksprites are a little too large relative to their bodies. The character with red hair in particular looks awkwardly proportioned compared to the other characters, especially with their sharper yet smaller head. It's also somewhat awkward that the talksprites face towards the player, and not eachother.

The protagonist has a pretty classic personality but manages to avoid being generic via the strong, thoughtful writing. The only demonstrably negative character is the one with green hair, who displays a highly generic joke personality that is extremely out of place amongst the otherwise genuine cast. The story itself has a great premise however the overarching mystery elements of the plot are not especially interesting, compared to the day to day relationship development of the characters. Hopefully the dramatic mysteries of the story will stay in the backseat for the forthcoming episodes and it will continue focusing on the more slice-of-life aspects that are generally much stronger.

Although the post story radio sequence was slightly amusing, the toll it may take on the immersion of the player and the respect the story itself commands doesn't really feel worth it. So if players do not like out-of-character immersion breaking comedy mini-shows they should avoid the radio sequence they unlock after completing the main story.


Several hours for several dollars is a pretty solid rate for such a well written story, especially with all the effort that went into the various backgrounds, music and talksprites.

4227,1479340,"I have played this game a few times and it is highly, highly frustrating and unforgiving. Its a very open/shut game with very little challenges or seems to be so far. No matter how I try, there is no longevity to it. You are extremely limited in what you can do. You are basically on a survival mission across the cosmos. You have to find resources and derelict containers to keep your ship ongoing. This sounds fantastic in principal, but it seems to be based a lot on luck. 

What annoys the most is that you can't BUILD anything. The game seems to focus around finding particular kinds of buildings. And you have to travel 8hrs average at a time to get anywhere. You have around 4 days of each supply left. But every time you get to a place, it takes an age to search each part, at the same time eating valuable resources. Then you will find a building you need! Awesome, I can produce the resource I need. Ah, but wait - most of these buildings are missing parts. And you have to find another building with missing parts to build it. Ironically, you will find buildings with other parts but you can't salvage those. So guess what? You will last 3 to 5 days of gametime and thats it. 

The only positive point is that graphically its pleasing. But you are extremely limited to what you can do. It feels like a linear game of luck. It just doesn't have enough substance to keep me entertained. Have to ask for a refund. It looked and sounded a lot more interesting from the description than the actual game content.

It feels more like a mobile game than a PC game. 3 to 5 pounds would be a fair price - I am curious to see what other people think or maybe I am doing something wrong?",0,1616101331,57,0,12
4228,1479340,"It's not good. In summary you 'travel' between text-based encounters and watch your resources count down. There's a basic 'city-building' thing on your ship where you might get a factory or two to slow down your resource drain... but if the RNG is unkind to you, you'll run out of oxygen, food or water.

So if you like a challenge, go for it, but you are warned.

4230,1479340,"I am only 3 hours in, and the game has been a lot of fun. I have perished EVERY game I have started as the RNG has been very brutal. I definitely think the difficulty could be toned down a bit. Nothing like having DAYS of resources, just to have the game force additional people on your ship. Those days of resources turn into hours very quickly, and before you know it, you are simply running for resources to survive instead of building your ship. To add to this, the game is still constantly hitting you with disasters which seem to increase as the game drags on. Another issue is that trying to become self sustainable is about impossible as none of the factories produce much. 

Again, I am only a few hours in, and I am sure I am missing some things that would make the game a bit easier. I plan to keep playing and experimenting, but as of now, unless you are into extreme hardcore survival and a lot of disappointing deaths, I would wait to buy until the game is a bit more balanced. I will revisit this review after I have spent more time in the game.",1,1616102667,873,0,14
4231,1479340,"Great idea for a game but seems inherently flawed due to the fact the whole game is based around RNG.  You start with a very small ship and 50 people as crew.  The crew needs basic resources to survive like food, water, and oxygen.  You have choices of where you would like to travel and there is a random chance that you will receive some of the resources listed above along with a bunch of of other resources like hydrogen (ship fuel), carbon, waste water etc...  I have had multiple play throughs where I literally only live for the first 3-5 jumps because I didn't receive the basic life sustaining resources and my crew died.

This game is similar to a city builder but instead of being able to build the ""city"" you have to take what you find and hope that it is what you need.  This adds a unique feel to the game but makes it brutally difficult even on the easiest settings.  You actually cant build anything in the game, you can only relocate certain buildings and combine parts of existing buildings to repair them into working order.  


At it's core this game is a resource management game.  You have to be mindful of how many crew members you bring on board as they will eat through your resource supply and cause you to lose the game if you don't keep an eye on it.  My biggest qualm with the game so far is that it forces you to onboard additional crew at different points of the game weather you have the resources or not.  I'm sure this was added as a challenge aspect but many, many times this is an instant death sentence for your ship even on the easiest setting. 

Most of the negative aspects of the game could potentially be patched to work better but in its current state the game is difficult and unrewarding since you don't unlock anything for playing and dying like most roguelites do.  However if you are looking for a near impossible challenge that is completely based on RNG and has nothing to do with how good you are at playing the game then this one is for you.",0,1617749959,466,0,6

4235,1479340,"The game is brutal but fantastic. It certainly does not cater to the mindset of there is always a way and instead in my opinion portrays a somewhat more realistic experience of the survival rate of a cataclysmic event.
It is a fairly simple game but you'll need to use any small advantage you can gain to actually survive and many times a bit of luck.

You only have enough water for one trip before you die.
Do you go for a guaranteed water source?
Maybe a riskier water source that contains enough to give you a bit of breathing room?
Or do you attempt to salvage a hull that you've detected a water treatment plant on in the hopes that some clean water will be stored for your immediate needs and you'll be able to use that facility to further your chances?

Every option requires consideration of what might happen during that event or in the future and sometimes it doesn't matter how well you planned because someone gave up hope and threw a spanner in the works dooming everyone.

As you play you'll learn about the possibilities of each event and what rewards or penalties are given to you giving the knowledge to progress a little further each time.

Despite the negative reviews (of which are mostly about the game difficulty) it is enjoyable, and deserves a chance and each playthrough is fast enough that you won't feel you've wasted hours to die unfairly.

Spoilerish:
Some tips to success:
Don't waste time, always keep your ship moving. Pick up a hull, start exploring and move to the next. The extra mass of a hull will make a trip less efficient, taking longer and costing more, but you can choose to travel slower and more efficiently to counter that at the cost of a longer journey. But during that time you can finish exploring the new hull and doing what you want with it before you get to your next destination. You'll have to learn to judge how to use this as you go.

Take your time. Attempting to rush through the story is not always the best option.

Move buildings off of new hulls to be discard last. Using the repair option takes time, and during that time the parts are still on that hull, but moving immediately removes it from that hull to take a bit more time to place it elsewhere, allowing you to discard that hull and continue with a slightly more efficiency journey without waiting a few hours.
In the same sense, rubble is useless and can be discarded without fully exploring it. Residencies appear to be the same taking a fair while to explore without offering anything unless you plan to use them. Sometimes you might be best to stop your crew exploring a residence to explore a storage first so you can discard, saving you a few hours.

Gaining crew is important and rare, which you should attempt to do at any available opportunity if it won't kill you (Expand the resource info panel to see actual numbers) but you can still survive without taking every opportunity to gain one. It is still best to ensure you have enough resources available for when the event occurs as it will make life easier.

Spoiler:
When you are reaching the finish, I've found it best to end on an asteroid you can continuously mine, this can give you a steady flow of secondary resources used to fuel your production of primary resources. This should massively increase your chances of success if you had any hope to start with but no guarantee",1,1616920391,254,0,3

First things first, The game is great and has a very neat aspect to it in which you are stranded in space and need to explore for resources and in a life and death situation. You are never guaranteed to find the resources you need, which is perfectly acceptable as the RNG of this game. So far I've only done one run and it seems that I was a lot more lucky than most since i got the void engine and never went into the yellow on resources and gained 4 out of 5 main components i believe being the water purifier, the scrubber the food synthesis and what ever the 4 edged building was, the thing I failed to get was the building that produces hydrogen. So when the game smacks you in the face with survive for ten days without any warning and halting the ability to continue exploring for that duration or even a chance to explore before hand is what kills the you and the game. When I was ""smacked"" I was able to survive for 6 days and could have won if I had only gotten that last building, what killed me was the lack of hydrogen, which was used to make food with the synthesis and with no other way to make food efficiently I had sadly died. To sum what I wrote up the game is extremely brutal even if you had a lucky game like me, if you fail to get all of the building before you have to survive the 10 days then you are screwed over since there would be no other way to gain the needed resources other than the 5 building. But what mattered was that it was fun I just wanted to rant about how close I was on my first run tbh 1.3hr run. :p",1,1616370616,81,0,2
4239,1479340,"Interesting concept. A bit hard to start out and unforgiving if your RNG is bad.

Well, sadly is not like that at all. It's turn based, and the resources you need run out before you can collect more.  You cannot go up, down, left, right... you can only go to one of the 4 - 5 choices the game gives you.

I studied the tutorial, played 3-4 times, and every time I ended up dead, either for lack of oxygen, food, or other critical resource.

Buildings that aren't the normal immovable ones can actually boost other buildings. It's not explained, but it seems that if one building outputs oxygen and another one uses it, then the one using it gets a boost by a small amount.

I’ll explain this later. For start let’s with what Alekon is. It’s a game of pictures. You get around making pictures of cute creatures. So yes, it’s like Pokemon Snap (not gonna lie, I bought it couse it was cheaper than that game). 
The story in here is… well… it exist. No masterpiece but at least it’s in tune with the game. You need to spark creativity and meet Alekon at the end. 
Going around, snapping pictures is fun. Progression is done well too. You need to solve simple puzzles to unlock new paths. The game even gives you some animation as reward. 
The best part though is wandering. After you finish all 3 paths in area, you’re free to explore. This is where you can find all poses of Fictions (the creatures are called like that).
But that’s not all. If you fulfill quests you’ll get new abilities, some stuff to customize pictures and even hub area. All so you can be creative. Quest are quite diverse in fact. Some are as simple as “pick right answer”, others require some investigating in the field and some require skill (which looks like I do not have.)
That leads me to reason why I love-hate this game. I enjoyed it quite a lot but music mini games made me rage quit. That was something I did not expect in relaxing game. No idea how kid would beat this.

If you've ever read/watched Steins;Gate, there are many similarities with this story. You will find the same idea of ""interesting sorta-scientific-sorta-made-up time travelling method"" and many of the same themes: good friends vs the new smart girl, lots of time travelling to try and fix the past, death, despair, finding out what/who is really important to you. It really is what you can expect from a dark-ish time travel story, but that doesn't mean its poorly written or boring. Sometimes it might get a little confusing, but overall it had me hooked for pretty much the entire game.

Speaking of poorly written, the obvious flaw of the game must be noted: the translation is very rough sometimes, and there are many typos, awkward word usage, letters or words missing and even chinese symbols at some points. Nothing makes the story unreadable at any point, but it can be quite immersion-breaking during some focal points.

The art is really great, between the sprites, backgrounds and chibi models, it is all very clean and high quality. The chibi sections are really adorable and the CGs are gorgeous. The music is also quite good too, nothing is insanely memorable, but most of the important themes hit the mark in terms of atmosphere.

This game should last for around 10 hours if you do all the endings (don't miss the secret true ending), and at the price tag of 10 euros, I find it worth the investment, although sales are always a thing. Said endings are really good and really highlight the possible ways the story can end, with some interesting twists, even if I found that one of the conclusions was described a bit too quickly.

The time travel mechanics are based in the idea of perception manipulating reality. The game begins, for example, with a musing on how the definition of a second has changed and how measuring and defining time affects how we perceive it. It's a philosophical and metaphorical approach that can predictably get a bit handwavey, but it gives the story a strong central theme and a satisfying ending.

The English translation is a weak point, with many awkward-sounding lines, typos, and formatting issues like stray quotation marks and a few lines left in Chinese. Not bad enough that it was unclear or too frustrating to read, but something I hope will be improved in future patches.

Subtle.) made by a powerful but sinister company. It manages to do its own thing though, adding in a mysterious killer gradually killing people permanently over each loop.

The translation is a little stiff with the occasional typo but honestly I’ve come to expect that from VNs translated from Chinese ( and the few I’ve read translated from Korean for that matter). The translator pool for that sort of thing is probably a bit weak.

Cast is pretty neat; the main character Ren is pretty energetic and inquisitive guy, proactively trying to solve the mysteries (to be fair dying every 12 hours presents plenty of incentive). His relationship with his childhood friend Cecilia is really cute as well in the way that they aren’t obviously in love but they’re just unthinkingly devoted towards each others happiness.

Several times throughout the story it asks the main character, Ren questions about whats going on with a life counter at the bottom of the screen with one life lost if you’re wrong. Normal enough but if you save and load after getting one wrong, the game literally goes “ I see you tried saving and loading. Hahaha nope. And the life remains lost (with seeing an ending the only way of restoring the lives) and since the good ending is locked behind full lives, you’re probably seeing a bad ending first time round. How mean. Did manage to shock me though.

The explanation behind the time travel is a bit out there but overall it’s a short coherent thriller of a story and it has some pretty good scenes of characters being driven to insanity by the constant time looping. 

It’s not a standout title but it ended up being a surprisingly solid read influenced but not derivative of the Infinity series as I initially expected.

There may be a few unexplained plot elements, but I think the suspension of belief can be held to make this a genuinely great time travel story. I felt enthralled by the characters and am honestly surprised to see such a sleeper hit. The art is really nice, and I laughed quite a bit at some of the banter and dialogue. I think what really made story worth it, however, was [spoiler]ending 0, which had him go in an infinite loop in a defiant act against god.

4299,1479500,"The story's about some toddlers trapped in a loop, on a train, under the sea, with a mysterious killer, in beakie and hood. The time loop mechanism feels less like the ones in your typical anime/manga/visual novels like Summer Time Rendering, Steins Gate or Higurashi When They Cry but more like Under Siege by George RR Martin, or honestly any similar work from the old man, down to every detail, except the one in Under Siege used psychic power or something and the toddlers here used, eh, a train.

Emmm...

The similarities aren't intentional, of course, and I do not wish to blame the writers for the many issues in the setting. It didn't really make sense in Under Siege, and it doesn't really make sense here. Cuz these kind of things usually don't. Tho the writers certainly made things worse with some very stupid explanations mixed with mysticism, perception, measurements of time, and physics...I don't know, I get the feeling that they are not serious. It's not 'look how smart we sound like' but a parody of someone trying to sound smart. I could be overthinking this but it's too stupid to be serious and I sure can turn my brain off and embrace the cringe, because I have no self-esteem.

Anyway, no matter, what I do have issues with is the main character.

You see, on paper, there's a good story buried inside, better than most Steam visual novels, even, say, Return to Shironagasu Island. But in practice, the main character comes across as a blistering fool. And the moment-to-moment experience suffers for it. 

A flawed setting or meandering plots can be overlooked momentarily if the moment to moment writing is good enough, but a frustrating main character is very difficult to ignore. I don't usually say things like this and honestly I prefer flawed protagonists but he is just...He literally destroyed the chance to solve this whole thing with minimal casualty by getting himself killed when climbing onto the roof of a train for no reason. And I swear that's one of the less stupid things he did in this game. People are in danger and he keeps on making jokes at crucial moments... ...He'll lie when you don't want him to lie. He'll antagonize people you want to befriend. He'll say things I don't even know anyone would say...just...

Why...

I guess I know why: The attempts to break the tone and inject humours resulted in the inconsistency of characters, where have I seen this before...My poorly written, poor poor boy, I hate you so much...

He did end up smarter in the secret sending, and he suffered a lot in it (GOOD), but the damage to his image in me heart is done and I digress.

The translation, while far from perfect, is still very readable. But the presentation, the conflict, the drawings and every single character were stellar! This is genuinely one of my favourite casts of VN characters in a good while. I just want to give every character a hug, because by Chronos do they deserve it (Cecilia is best).

Ahem, anyway, all in all, I enjoyed it. There were a few twists and turns and some choices you make which require you to understand what's going on, but nothing too hard if you've been following along.

The music was good. Specifically during the tense moments. It really did bring out the atmosphere and it really feels something is about to happen. Oh, and the music that played when all hope is lost... Probably biased, but I really do like how it brought out the feels.

As for the endings, well, you'll know if you've hit all of them if you check the CG collection.

Also, take it as you will, but I feel scammed by the way they numbered the endings. But it's not a bad thing, lol. But yeah, make sure you get all the endings.

The main issue with the game is the translation. There were some typos, and instances where during conversations, people's names get swapped around. But thankfully it's usually obvious who actually said what though. Another thing is that when looking through the backlog to look at what was said previously, there's text that gets cut off if it's too long. It'd be nice if that didn't happen so that I don't need to depend on my failing memory to remember what characters said 3 seconds ago xD
Hope it does get fixed in the future though.

The time travel was decently done though I still don't fully understands the logic behind it. 
There are a few spelling errors or poor choices of words that stem from the translation that can probably be fixed easily but it's not bad enough to create misunderstanding, even though it does hurt immersion.
The store page description says this has 400k words but its more like 40k words (if that), which was the biggest disappointment to me but even then this is still worth its price if you like time travel. If not I would suggest waiting for a sale.

Before my review I would also like to complain about crashes and bugs that happen throughout the game. They mostly occur some time before the next turn starts, and I always have to restart my game. Please fix this so people who play this in the future will have a better experience!

The writing 文笔(not plot) is decent; not too many difficult words since it's written by a light novelist plus it's a VN and not a novel. The story is enjoyable and the interactions between characters are fun to watch. I thought the characters could use a bit more development within the first few hours, but as I approached the end of the story this game proved me wrong. :) There was just enough development, not too much, not too less. 

The plot is very good, with lots of suspense and plot twists. Some things were obvious, but I was not ready for those roller coaster rides. First they give u despair, gives u hope, takes the hope away, gives u new hope, and then gives u new despair... The main reason I picked up this VN is because of the time travel and looping, but it gave me a really pleasant surprise with their emphasis on the perception of time. The only complaint I have for the plot is there is plot point between Denes and Sol which isn't handled until the end of the game, but they did a very great job as there are no plot holes. This is a short game(VNDB records around 9+ hours on average) however and I certainly felt satisfied enough with how things turned out, although I think there was definitely room for more branching. 

The art is very good for this price point, and the music is decent as well. The opening movie is an absolute banger!",1,1656085416,640,0,6

However, I feel that Baobab's mausoleum is severely lacking, especially in the gameplay department.

At most times, the game plays like a worse version of an RPG maker game. The main character walks slowly with no dash  option. Picking up items triggers dialogue and an unskippable 5 second animation. The RPG gameplay mainly includes walking around form one point to another, solving easy puzzles that are pointless from a story perspective and also boring. The game has a Final Fantasy style turn-based RPG scene built into it, but it's implemented so lazily it's hard to call it a feature; you fight a janitor by pressing attack 3 times and win. The same goes for the part of the game that turns into first person.

And the style, while it is unique to say the least, did not impress me much more than pixel art with rather wacky characters (the main character is FBI agent with an eggplant for a head and lettuce for hair).

To summarize, it is a cool experience if you like exploring unique worlds and don't mind it being slow.

I'm often on the fence when deciding to buy TB games, as many of them feel uninspired and end up being very repetitive (i.e. click attack or one of a few optimal skills throughout much of the game).  Even though I've only played Vendir: POL for a few hours, the combat has been fun and allows for a variety of tactics, particularly when you start to get into the skill tree.  Since you can look ahead to see what the future skills involve, as well as essentially determine your class by the skills and attributes chosen each level, it's easy to create a well balanced build.  I really enjoy the way the skill tree and attribute systems are designed, which definitely helps prevent the player from having to start over due to creating a build that's less than optimal.  Also, the skills (which also include some spells) are designed to integrate with each other symbiotically, so you can make some pretty crazy combinations and have a lot of fun with it.

Another plus is that the upgrade points come at a steady pace and allow you to improve your character on a regular basis.  I'm currently playing on the normal setting and the difficulty is very well balanced. I could probably handle hard, but I've heard it's quite difficult, so will reserve that for a future play-through.  Since the harder the difficulty, the better the drops, I can see the game changing dynamically when playing on hard vs. normal or easy (which adds to the fun factor). 
 
Although there is no voice acting, I have enjoyed the story/narrative so far, and there have only been a few grammatical errors.  Vendir: POL won't win any awards for best story, but the characters are interesting and the devs did a good job of setting up the world in the first couple of hours to give you a reason to keep playing.  The graphics also aren't the best in the world, but I do like how they portray the world, which is definitely bleak and unforgiving (at least in the early hours).  The music is also fantastic, which helps balance out the lack of voice acting. 

Overall, I heartily recommend this game.  Hope you enjoy it too :)

Cheers,

H

4355,1478850,The game is good for a mobile port. It is a light CRPG with a grimdark setting and good amount of customization. The only downside for me was the lack of proper mouse movement.,1,1717165158,545,0,43
4356,1478850,"As far as mobile ports go, this one isn't completely terrible.
Here's 40ish minutes of gameplay in a video(I didn't speak, just gameplay): 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtOh-Owdogs

I waited a while for this one, I really wanted to be positive about it... but:

I tried to have my pro gamer move moment by stealing the fellow party members gear, only to later find out that everything you find in the start zone is for nothing, because it all gets taken from you. That feels pretty terrible and is a bad start to the game.

The writing is... definitely not this games strong suit. But it's better than the graphics. Some characters will offer very little in the form of constructive dialogue, others will just randomly insult you and tell you to go get... well, let's just leave it at, they're not very nice.
Edgy characters can be great, but this game doesn't have that, it has badly written characters. There's a difference.

The humour in this game goes more for ""lolrandom!"" rather than actual humour. It's very in your face, obvious, not very well done. It's like it's trying too hard to be silly. Hey, some people like that... I really don't.

A major issue with dialogue came quite early, when I made my character an academic and chose an option to say something smart. It came up with stars telling me that my character said a lot of smart sounding long words... This is abysmal. There are great ways to tell people you've said long smart sounding words and that is to write down the long smart sounding words. 
I get that it was just some off hand dialogue to bewilder a dimwitted guard, but instead of giving the player some proper feedback on what the character said, it was just surrounded with asterisks and waived away.

The text comes up on the right hand of the screen, leaving the middle to show your characters. I thought this would mean that instead of asterisks, we'd see the characters do things. But later in the tutorial, someone looked to someone beside them and instead of just doing that, it came up in asterisks.
Again, there are better ways to show people doing things in games, and that's to show them.

The text also comes up in a huge wall whenever anyone has more than a paragraph to say. There was a quest outside the starting area where someone wanted someone else killed. But instead of just saying that, they went into a ton of reasoning for it, saying a whole lot of words without saying very much at all. This in itself is fine, encouraged in fact, it adds flavour to a character. The problem is, it came up as one large block of text and wasn't very enjoyable to read at all.

See how I'm doing my review for this game, I'm pressing enter a lot, I'm spacing it out. If this were one large block of text without spacing, it'd be horrifying to read. (For all I know, it is bad to read, and for that I can only apologise, but I'm at least trying my best to make it easier. You should do the same.)

There was an achievement in the tutorial for begging someone and to do that, I had to choose the beg option many, many, many times... It got very boring very fast. There were also many asterisks.

The UI is shockingly bad; I get that this is a mobile port, but this game has serious issues when it comes to showing you things. To view the tool tip for spells, you have to right click on the spells. To view the tooltip for looted items, you have to hold left click on the item. Right clicking just loots it. It's also right click in the inventory. So why is it click and hold for one time?
It'd be better if the tool tip just stayed up instead, there's plenty of space on a monitor that a mobile doesn't have and you should use it, make your port look less lazy.

The combat is turn based, which is fine. A great many games over the years have been and many of them have been fantastic. The problem is, it's not very inspired. There's a limit break bar at the bottom that actually says limit break on it. All this does is give you an extra turn. No fancy abilities, no omnislash. Just another turn.
There's mana that gets consumed by everything, I found that the best tactic was to inflict a dot (Damage over time) with my plague doctor, then have them just wait around so they can cast healing spells on the other character that was with me, who I was mostly using as a jack of all trades. 

The abilities are a bit confusing, some require other abilities to set them up, you'll have to remember what does what. This is fine, but would be far better if the tool tip stayed on screen.

The talent screen is abysmal. Everything is so vastly spread out and it appears in a tiny box in the middle of your screen. Why not fill the screen instead? Then you can fit more and it'll even look better.

Also... is the necromancer a joke class? Like, I've heard people jokingly say that a necromancer is just a healer that arrived late. But having your necromancer class genuinely be a healer feels weird. 
The plague doctor being a healer makes sense and having diseases they can spread is very cool. But the necromancer should not be a healer. That's just unusual. At that rate, you may has well make the pyromancer a healer too and have them cauterise wounds. (Joking, don't do this.) 

Quests, there are TONNES of quests, fresh out the gate, you start in a pretty grotty place, there are quests everywhere, where should I go? What should I do? Who knows! The previous game had some direction with quests, this one does not.
And there's just so much dialogue, which, again, not this games strong suit. From looking at other reviews, the quests are largely just go there, kill that, come back, go out again, kill that one now, then back again.... Not very interesting.

The graphics are quite bad, but not as bad as I was expecting given other peoples reviews. It's a bit blurry and doesn't really work properly on a large screen, but I half expected that. My video will better show this to you.

There's a crafting system, because every game needs one of those. Unfortunately, like most crafting systems, it's pretty terrible.

Honestly. This game is probably better avoided. In my opinion, it's really bad.
But maybe you'll like it more than I did? Maybe you enjoy silly in your face humour and uninspiring turn based combat.
Personally... I cannot recommend this. I really didn't like it.
But you're not me.


If you play it, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.
If you don't play it, I really cannot blame you.
Regardless of what you choose to do, I hope you have a wonderful day.
Thank you for reading this, or skipping to the bottom, whichever. Much love! <3



P.S. To the developers, I'm sorry I was so harsh about your game, but when you put something out and ask people for money then you'll get various different responses to it. I wanted to give this one a positive, but I just cannot do that. If you ever update your game to fix any of the issues I had with it, then I'll gladly alter this review.

If it weren't for some reviews here, I wouldn't have known it was originally a mobile game, it didn't feel/play like it at all, it just felt like a light-weight rpg worth every penny of $15.

The Great:
🟩 Steam Deck Performance 10/10 - I played almost entirely on Steam Deck and it ran perfectly.
🟩 Dialogue  9/10 - Straight up enjoyable dialogue. Witty characters, funny interactions.
🟩 Customization - 9/10 - Great customization of your hero and teammates, plenty of builds to try out and tweak AND you can reset characters individually very easily if you want to try something different.


The Okay:
🟨  Combat 7/10 - The most fun part of combat was just trying out different build combos and seeing them perform. But in terms of actual combat, it began to feel repetitive and ""just got to get through this"" at the very end. 

 [h2]Addressing Some Reviews: [/h2]

[b]""You have to play a mana tank healer or pay to heal after every fight!"" [/b]
Just not true. There is a ton of food crafting in this game, I never paid to heal until late-game when I just had so much money that I didn't need to bother with gathering/crafting anymore.
You also gain more teammates, at no point are you forced to turn your main hero into anything. I played with 1 tank and barely healed in combat at all.

.. what? Press select, click save. Literally any time except mid dialogue or in combat.

This game is an asset flip and the dev even had the audacity to ban me from the community hub because i did the community a service and made the information available for all to see via links i posted.
 
So what grounds did he ban me on ?

""You have been permanently banned from the pinball Hub.
You were banned by a pinball developer.
Reason: ""Posting spam""""

First ban i ever had on steam or any where else on the web.

Besides of that he completely wiped away all comment from everyone else at that time so i can only wonder how many other people in those posts got banned as well.

Link to Pinball Creator asset package - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/pinball-creator-74772

Atleast 2 of those tables are complete asset flips already available in the Pinball Creator asset package released as they was made by this ""dev"" (Zombie Fiesta and Octopus Island)  and unfortunately they are by far the best of the 11 tables available in this game and that doesnt really say much as they are already sub par to begin with.

I also made it clear that one of the tables was already available for free or cheaper on steam in various releases.

Pinball Inside: A VR Arcade Game
https://store.steampowered.com/app/605850/Pinball_Inside_A_VR_Arcade_Game/
Skully Pinball
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059190/Skully_Pinball/

The game is clearly ""made"" by someone with a slim knowledge of the game of pinball first of all the control setup is like this:

S: Left Fliper.
D: Left Tilt - For those not very familiar with pinball its not called tilt but nudge, Tilt is when you nudge the machine too much and the flipper breaks and the ball drains, ergo tilt.
L: Right Flipper.
K: Right Tilt/Nudge.
Enter: Ball Plunger.

The great majority of all pinball games ever released will have a control scheme using the left and right shift buttons and the space bar for nudging and the down arrow as the plunger.
 
I cant 100% say if the ""dev"" has made the remaining 9 tables with the assets or if they are finished tables imported from that asset package as well but even if  he has made them its not really an accomplishment as they could have been made by toddler or a drunken monkey throwing in fairly arbitrary assets on the tables. i pretty much just grazed them but as an more than experienced pinball player who has bought allmost everything on steam including all dlcs of the big 3 (pinball fx2/3, pinball arcade and zaccaria pinball) and spend propably over 1000 hours on steam playing pinball games and i can only say they are bad excuses for pinball tables. Even pinball games from the amiga 500 days of the early 1990ies are aeons ahead of this sorry excuse of a ""game""

Flippers seems slightly off in timing
I used the Tilt (nudge) at some point and the game broke and i could only close the game by using CTRL-TAB-ALT
Ball got stuck on one of the tables and i had to quit to the main menu.
Had the occourence that the ball slipped through the base of the flipper.

All of this happening in the short span of time of 33 minutes of game time so do i really need to say more ?

Overall, I like this game, a lot. It's very challenging and really fun to just pick up and play.

I am absolutely infatuated with the music, 80's synthwave is possibly one of my favorite genres ever, and the sound effects are pleasant to listen to, so no complaints in the audio department.

The art style is phenomenal, I will always love 80's Neon Futurism, and pair that with some stellar pixel art, art department gets a solid 5/5.

Okay, now, especially considering the game just launched are there will naturally be flaws to iron out, I'll try to point out some of the problems I experienced + some pet peeves.

Pet peeves, first:

- There is no counter for the time rewind power up. I'm not sure if this is deliberate or not, but having a counter to know how many of the time rewind power ups I have to spend would be nice. To my understanding, it's per character, not overall, so sometimes I'll try to use the power up with a character and end up realizing that I picked it up with the other character and die;

- There could be better indicators as to where exactly the time rewind will put you. Often times I'll find myself using the power up, only to have it put me [b]right on top, mid-jump[/b], of a vortex, making me die anyway. Maybe give the player the ability to decide where to end the power up, by holding / letting go of Shift for that, but still, adding some sort of meter, limiting the amount of rewinding that can be done.

Problems:
- This didn't happen too often, but, sometimes, when I'd try to use a power up with, say, the Blue runner, and I'd be close, but not [b]too[/b] close to a Yellow portal, pressing shift would still make me die anyway (one time this problem happened, the Blue runner died twice in rapid succession, thus making me feel like this is indeed a problem);

- Now this is the big one. This problem is preventing me from completing the game, as of the time I'm writing this review. Many, many times, right after a swap (spacebar), the runner [b]will not jump high enough[/b] and get killed by a vortex. Seems to happen more, if not all times, to the Yellow runner. I'm at level... 7, maybe? And I'm simply stuck there because this glitch seems to happen often, and this level has a lot of areas where you have to swap between the runners very quickly.

All in all, this game is BEAUTIFUL, I repeat and reinstate all of the compliments I gave this game, and I really hope this becomes successful. Everyone involved did a tremendous job and I offer nothing but sincere kudos and heartfelt congratulations ♥",1,1613687933,70,0,16

Also the UI is confusing and un-intuitive. For example, I couldn't figure out how to select a different track to drive.

This game is a huge sandbox. You can edit cars and the track editior is very powerful. Both editors take some time to get used to but it's not that bad. The community made a good effort to have some leagues, cars and very well done tracks in the workshop.

You also not only get simple racing, there are many modes like sumo, car soccer, ctf and some more fun modes.

The overall appereance doesn't look like much but underneath this game has a brilliant and sturdy netcode which allows for the best multiplayer races that I ever witnessed. Due to the eidtor you get everything from super arcady and weird to super serious driving cars.
The Sandbox aspect also means that you don't have to stick to the standard available cars which are liked by some and dislike by others (I am group 2). 

There are only 2 negative points with TSU imo. Firstly, the game currently has no possibilty to drive against AI. This may make playing on your own very one sided. Secondly, the menus and UI are work in progress so sometimes navigating through the game can be very confusing.

As the dev of this game is very active and communicative he already confirmed that he is working on AI and better UI. Sp my two critical points are already under construction.

Its a modern mix of arcade gaming and modern AI. There are several game modes. Racing, Sumo, CTF, Deathmatch, and even serious gp racing. The community is small but very actice. The devoloper is understanding to the community and takes all request in cosidaration. No promises thought 🤣. Every week are several happinings where you can be part of. Rather it is just fun or serious competition. I specially like the fact that you can build your own maps, tracks, etc... imagination is the only limit. The level editor is limited and not the fastest to learn, but if you use discord and join the community there, help is at hand all the time.
 
Plusses:
- everything from fun driving, sliding, to serious racing.
- arcade feeling in 3d
- AI for single player (first priority 4 developer)
- Lots of different game modes.
- Very active community (specially on discord)
- Every week happenings (some of them offer you to win dlc's or gift cards)
- 24h servers to play online with friends
- There are regular updates
- Create cars with your own settings
- lecel editor to make own tracks

Minus
- Slow to learn level editor (but lots of help from people in the comminity if you use discord
- level editor is limited

All together considering it is a game still in development, there is actually nothing to complain about.
Worth the price!!!

4463,1478350,"Play game dev tycoon instead.

This game tries to do everything it does, but add more depth without understanding why tycoon had its systems in the first place. A lot of small things really add up to make this just a crappy Unity game. Example; developing a game produces bubbles, just like in game dev tycoon. Unlike in game dev tycoon, if your game is approaching stage 2 or 3 in development, any bubbles still ""floating"" to the development will disappear and not matter. 

The BIG thing that makes me really not like this game and just want to play game dev tycoon over this is the integral part of the game. When creating a game, just like in game dev tycoon, you have sliders for different aspects of the game like level design, sound, whatever. I am fine with using another game's mechanics, even blatantly ripping it off in a way, but this game doesn't ever understand the point of it having the sliders with percentages and how the genre values the game. It turns out, despite the game tutorial telling you to watch how much the game genre you're developing cares about the level design, game play, whatever, it doesn't matter at all. 

The ONLY thing that matters is at the very end, the distribution of design & tech need to be within the suggested parameters, or else the game will suck. The sliders don't matter. The end % is all the game cares about. Basically; don't buy it. Don't buy it if it's on sale. Don't get it if it's free. Game is dog water.

Game Dev Tycoon is old as hell and is still the best, most polished game dev simulation there is. If you've had enough of that game, then check out game dev studio - it's basically this, but much, much better. Also try game dev story, it's pretty good if a little janky.

4473,1478350,"Many years ago, in 2012, I played Game Dev Tycoon and realized I had a love for these types of games. However, my competitive nature soon took over and I grew bored of how easy it was to succeed in Game Dev Tycoon. This led me to trying more Tycoon / Management / Simulation games and I never felt satisfied with how easy it was to win in these types of games. 

I've played many games in this genre, and this is easily top 2 for me, with the other being Mad Games Tycoon 2. Mad Games Tycoon 2 has multiplayer, which adds an extra element that I wish this game had but it doesn't take away from the exceptional single player experience Game Dev Masters has to offer. 

If you are like me, and you want a challenging Tycoon / Management / Simulation game, then you will greatly enjoy Game Dev Masters. There are easier difficulties if you don't want the challenge, and the Dev is possibly the most active Dev I've ever encountered in his discord. The game is great fun, the community is engaged, and features are constantly being added or updated. 
An example of the Developer's activity in the discord is that I suggested a feature, the dev liked the idea, and plans to implement it in some capacity in the future. 

Also, don't be turned off by the challenging aspect. The game isn't terribly difficult, just enough to stimulate your brain and provoke actual thought. The ""Normal"" difficulty is great for learning and pretty forgiving, while Hard & Master difficulties are as challenging as you would expect. 


Thank you Ryan for doing an incredible job and creating one of my favorite games in the genre. Game Dev Masters is easy to learn but hard to master, give it a try if you enjoy the genre! You won't be disappointed!",1,1659547845,3377,0,1

The game is in very active development by a game developer that has the passion and the will to bring this game a life of its own. All in all very promising and definately worth a buy.",1,1657270048,34,0,7
4475,1478350,"ok let me review this game 
i am a simulation/management  tycoon lover of any kind
on game dev tycoon games i ll give u some examples of playtimes
game dev studio 10 hours,game dev tycoon 49 hours, mad games tycoon 1 around 45 hours,mad games tycoon 2 around 90hours,gamers go makers 30 hours and so on
lets say i have huge experience with game dev games
i have a feeling i ll surpass the 200 hours of gameplay with this game
the level of depth in game 
the level of difficulty in the game in   a first glance
the option to make the games categories genres topics effect on players and so on random is omg 
no game u are going to start will be the same with another
in my first 2 games one i lost in 1 year with a difficulty level of 1540% 
the second on 800+ difficulty i was developing game englines and was making my money as a cut from companies making games using my commercial engines and survived for around 10 years before i made a mistake and bankrupt myself again
the game has amazing potencial
still has some things to improve 
the fast time option works like a charm
i think during training our avatar gets e bit too much research points but thats a preferance
i didnt go so deep in the game to see the maximum platforms , internet games , zonras or economic depth of the game but i can tell u with outmost belief
if the developer continues to support this game (in eartly access still but feels like a complete game) we ll be talking maybe for for the game dev tycoon game that will be the measurement how a good tycoon game can be made
would love to have some events being added to the game
would love to have a bit better ui but still works for me (would prefer something like football managers ui ) since it has so many tabs but still its very functional
minor complains there but main first impression is omg
would i recommend the game??
hell yeah
would i recommend it in its current price??
its a steal (would have put the game in the price range of around 20 -22 e)
its 1 meal worth of macdonalds or some kind of fast food restaurant and will last u wayyyy longer
if u like challenging games ,the 1st difficult (really dfficult ) game tycoon dev title in so long, give it a try
try the demo and see for yourselves 
early impressions 8/10
will update review after 30-40 hours to see how far in the game i can go

I liked learning the mechanics and getting better at... everything ? I highly recommend using the Options / Help menu. It's far from perfect but it gets the job done when you want to better understand a mechanic.

However, after clocking 15+ hours of gameplay, what was fun is now becoming work, so I'm pretty much done with the game. But I'm happy with the price I paid and I wish there were more neat niche games like this one.",1,1680637794,1917,0,58

I appreciate this game taking something like Game Dev Tycoon and improving on it in those areas. The HUD however is kinda generic and I think this game needs to choose a better style an aesthetic. Sometimes menus get stuck and sometimes I accidentally click the release game button which doesn't let you exit the menu, so you're forced to delay the game or just ship it out a few weeks before a game convention. But overall this is a solid game.",1,1626132247,611,0,28
4486,1478350,"It is a pretty solid simulator but does not offer much replay ability in its current state.  Took about 5hrs to research everything, create a monopoly on game developement, max out all employee stats, max out the office, max out all perks, deep dive every topic, and everything else.  Once you acquire all companies, money and fans will never be an issue.  Also the engine system is a little overpowered.  When you create an engine for commercial use, you can put the profit share to 30% and you'll be rich before you can blink.  It satisfies the void left by game dev tycoon.



If you want a semi-casual experience I recommend this game.
If you want a more in-depth and full on simulator/tycoon, then I recommend Mad Games Tycoon 2.

I put this game right up there with those.",1,1700926250,1197,0,2
4492,1478350,"Let me start by saying that I've played most games related to gamedev and have yet to find the perfect game. I'm a developer myself and unfortunately these games often lack a real simulation of actual game production and 'gamedev' is often just a skin for games about setting up an office and making bigger and bigger numbers in bubbles (yes, I'm thinking of Game Dev Tycoon among others).

What does it look like with GameDevMasters?

Game development process here is implemented in an interesting way, I like the randomness and the ability to influence it.
There are a lot of options and opportunities to develop company, office and employees in the game. However, it should be noted that this has little to do with real game production. On the other hand, solutions and limitations introduced in the game are defensible because gameplay itself is interesting and engaging. 
Game runs stably.

What I miss most about the game is the whole gamedev ecosystem involved with, missing game and console sales results worldwide, best selling games etc. It's like our company is operating in isolation from other developers, there's no mechanism for competition in the market.
Publishing games is solved in a strange way - we can either publish them ourselves or put them on steam. Publishers cannot be used. Interestingly, self-publishing games seems to be more beneficial than uploading to steam. There is also a lack of information about the number of games sold if we release on steam. Apart from that there are a few things that are strangely resolved, e.g. production time for DLC is roughly 3 times longer than production time for the whole game, making ports for consoles also takes quite a long time and as a result no new games are created for release, we just get a one-off amount of money. The development time is too short in my opinion and life cycle of games is not very realistic.
There are also some things I don't fully understand, such as game genre trends or market share by platforms.

Despite the problems, I give it a positive rating because the gameplay was engaging. If you compare it to other games in the genre, you have to admit that it is a bit different, in some places it is much more developed, and in other places it is much poorer (for example, there is no office arrangement, which for me is an advantage). If you are looking for a breath of fresh air in the genre, you will find it here, but you need to be aware of the limitations and strange solutions. 
However, in gamev genre, the old GameBiz 3 is still number 1 for me.",1,1700485610,694,0,3
4493,1478350,"Let's you be silly, dumb, or really weird.

4495,1478350,"Game Dev Masters is an absolute gem in the world of video game development simulators. As an avid gamer and aspiring game developer myself, I was thrilled to dive into this immersive experience and test my skills in the dynamic and ever-evolving gaming industry. And boy, did it deliver!

First and foremost, the attention to detail in Game Dev Masters is astonishing. The game captures the essence of the game development process flawlessly, from brainstorming ideas to managing teams, designing game play mechanics, and handling marketing strategies. The developers have left no stone unturned in creating an authentic and realistic experience, making it an ideal game for both enthusiasts and industry professionals.

One of the standout features of Game Dev Masters is its depth and complexity. You're not just tasked with designing games; you also have to manage your studio's finances, research and develop cutting-edge technologies, negotiate contracts, and navigate the ever-changing market demands. This intricate web of decision-making keeps you constantly engaged, strategizing, and adapting to the challenges thrown your way. The learning curve might be steep, but it rewards your efforts with a deep sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

The game offers a wide variety of game genres, platforms, and technologies to choose from, allowing you to experiment and unleash your creativity. Whether you prefer to create indie masterpieces or blockbuster AAA titles, Game Dev Masters caters to all types of game development styles. The ability to customise and fine-tune every aspect of your games, from graphics to sound design, adds an extra layer of personalisation and creative freedom.

Furthermore, the game's visuals are simply stunning. The attention to detail in the game's environments, characters, and animations is remarkable. It's evident that the developers poured their passion for game development into creating a visually captivating experience. Coupled with a vibrant and dynamic soundtrack, Game Dev Masters immerses you into its world, making you feel like a true game development tycoon.

Additionally, the inclusion of a multiplayer side to the game enhances the overall experience.Competing with friends or other players online adds an exciting dimension to the game. Participating in global game development competitions  fosters a sense of community and adds longevity to the game play.

If there's one small critique I have, it's that the interface could be slightly more intuitive, especially for newcomers to the genre. Although the game provides ample tutorials and tool tips, it takes a bit of time to fully grasp the intricacies of the mechanics. However, once you get the hang of it, Game Dev Masters becomes an incredibly rewarding and addictive experience.

In conclusion, Game Dev Masters stands tall as a true masterpiece among game development simulators. Its attention to detail, depth of game play, stunning visuals, and multiplayer mode create an immersive and unforgettable experience. Whether you're a seasoned game developer or a passionate gamer looking for an authentic behind-the-scenes adventure, Game Dev Masters is a must-play.

Only 4 hours in but I'm looking to exponentially increase that time. It's really helping me stay motivated and distracted throughout the day.

For anyone looking for specific criticisms:

Cons:
- Character model customization is limited to just a few options
- Lengthy popup hints
- A VERY complex and in-depth game (mind you, it is being developed by a single man)
- It's not entirely necessary, but having a general idea of ratios and probability will be useful since it is heavily emphasized

Pros:
- You can have one save file last for potentially hundreds of hours if you choose because of the tycoon-esque style
- A good game for those who like to plan/strategize their objectives
- There are difficulty settings that challenge even the best game devs with a reasonable difficulty curve for each of them
- Could be considered a con in others' eyes, but there's really no overarching story to follow; you make your own

- Even tho the awards are very simplistic now it is satisfying to get a GOTY award and seeing your fan amount growing because of it
- Studio Perks and employee Perks allow you to have some impact on how your company and employees perform which is great

4524,1478350,"I've really enjoyed the few hours I've played on here but unless I'm missing something there is no 'save' option.  If you try something, or miss a trick when you're in the red at the bank it's game over.  There's no load save option so the hours spent getting from the small office to the medium office is lost.  I was in the black, developing a game and added costs took me into the red.  Gutted, frustrated and cannot be bothered repeating hours of work to get back to this point.  Three times it's happened, once when I moved from my desk to make a brew and the other times because I took my eye off the ball.

I picked up a game to continue from last night and was mid way through developing a game with my first employee.  Went into the red mid way through development again.  Gave over - and the automatic save saved the game at that point.  Why would you save the game at the point you've lost?  I'm just not willing to invest the time to start over again.  

One last point - I noticed I was in the red on this last occasion and tried to take out a loan to cover me.  The loan system needs some work as you can't see how much you're borrowing.  And when you move the slider it goes from borrowing £31k to displaying zero's.  I moved the slider across to the maximum where it said I could borrow £40k even though it was displayed as zero's.  It still only gave me £31k.  And now as I'm typing this I'm kicking myself because I've just remembered from playing last night I could have sold some shares.  All that time lost because of one stupid mistake in game play and no way to recover due to the lack of restore points.

I will keep an eye out in the future to see if this gets developed and this is the only reason for me why I'm leaving this game for now.  Other than this, I really loved the game and it's early access so look forward to you fixing this.",1,1623408331,349,0,4

4535,1478470,"When I found out about this game I got really excited. I am a big fan of Fishy and Fishy2, so I had high expectations for this new addition to the series. Now that I've played it, I am quite disappointed. I understand that this game is still very new, and that a lot of it's problems will probably get fixed soon, but right now it's basically unplayable. The frame rate drops constantly, the hitboxes of Fishy himself, and the enemies seem way off, and I've even fallen through the ground a few times. 
Another problem is the music. For some reason, every time the level loads (both when you die, or when you progress to another level), the volume resets to 100% (which is very loud). Not to mention the music is the worst thing my ears have ever had to endure.
I can definitely see what this game is trying to do; and I think going into 2d is a fun idea, but as a fan of the series it hurts me to have to say that I would not recommend the game for what it is right now.

Well it`s worth the price! I enjoyed the mix of styles for finding objects and solving puzzles. I enjoyed the multiple HOS as they were straight forward, not too difficult, and I received several needed objects as opposed to the typical one item. I like the storyline, it made me use my brain without being overtaxed or too frustrated and I learned some facts especially about 16th century France. The visual and sound quality were absolutely beautiful. The music was soothing and didn't become annoying as the hour went on. The HO scene were nicely drawn (no Garbage piles with senseless items) and most of these scenes were played differently than other games I have played and the novelty was a real treat. Minipuzzles were a little bit easier than I like it which means I could do all of them without much frustration and never skipped.

4570,1478590,"Twin-stick shooter crossed with survival horror that never gels together well.  The game is slow-paced which makes the twin stick mechanic feel out of place and almost the entire game can be easily played with the infinite-ammo pistol, making the ""survival"" aspects feel moot and most of your arsenal irrelevant.  The story is largely incoherent and, again, feels made up of a bunch of different threads that never come together into a full plot: cultists, gene-experiments, a power station thing, a living organic ""building"", etc.  You have zombies but then you have snakemen and machine-gun wielding skeleton soldiers and walking trees and the overall feeling was a stewpot full of ""This would be cool"" concepts but not enough time to cook into one dish.

There ARE some cool ideas in the game if they had picked one theme and leaned into it.  And I enjoyed how environments played into the game such as traps that could hurt monsters, destructible fences leading to secret areas, accidentally destroying street lamps and plunging yourself in darkness, etc.  Given more time to cook -- more action, more need for other weapons making ammo conservation a factor, a more solid story -- this could be a decent game but it's not there yet.  Right now it's more lackadaisical gameplay unsupported by a story to make you want to get through it (or conversely, good enough gameplay to make you ignore the flaws in the story).",0,1657475848,266,0,83
4571,1478590,"Been following this game since early access stages and it has definitely improved a lot. Visual style is unique and colourful which reminds me somehow the old Amiga games with more HD look. Although toning down some particle effects would make action more clear.

Gameplay is solid and fun. You aim your gun, shot fires and it hits. Environment gives an extra level of strategy, as you can outsmart monsters to walk into traps, mines, explode barrels near them, or even get them stuck in each others corpses. 

Sound effects could be more impactful and some effects (like mines) were still missing. Music was subtle, atmosphereic and not too overwhelming.

I'd recommend to keep and eye on this game as devs are constantly improving and listening to feedback!

It's a reasonably well-done puzzle platformer. The controls are decent for the most part, although the sliding under walls could use some fine-tuning. The graphics and sound are both fine. It supported my Logitech F310 gamepad with no problems.

There are few frustrating things at first, until you get used to them. Rats at your feet that you can't kill because you can't aim up or down, arrows that come from enemies that are off-screen with little warning, and spikes out of the ground with no obvious indication they are there. 

 You get 5 lives with 3 HP each to start, then can get more lives apparently, according to one of the patch notes in the forum. When the lives are gone, you start over. That is the main reason that I probably won't play this any more. I have become very intolerant of redoing content in any game. I can deal with the cheap deaths, but not if it means starting over...and over...and over. 

Yes, I saw ""Roguevania"" in the tags, but it was on sale for $1.24 so It was worth a try. And this is why I am still giving it a recommend. If you can deal with starting over as you learn where the spikes and arrows are, then it is a fun game.",1,1613602701,31,0,89

4585,1478650,"After more than a decade of technical issues preventing this game from being played at more than 2fps without registry editing, it has been revived! This game is in the same vein as other colony survival games such as Oxygen Not Included, Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress, but with more focus on the story and quests provided throughout the campaign.

When you start the campaign, you have access to only five Diggles and a campfire. In order to progress from this point, you must train your Diggles in many different skills (Wood, Stone, Transport, Food, etc) by performing tasks related to the skill. Once skill requirements have been met, these Diggles can then unlock new buildings and items for you to use, which will also have their own unlockable items and buildings from as well. As these Diggles have individual skill sets, you will need to micromanage your units to level them into the skills they require to unlock the objects you need to progress, and if they die to one of the many hazards in the game, you will need to restart the upskilling process with another Diggle.

The Diggles also have their own individual needs, so a large portion of the early mid-game is focused around maximising their mood in order to keep them happy, through the invention of better meals, nicer sleeping quarters, access to baths and to a bar for them to party. By maximising their needs, they will work harder during their work hours, and this will also prevent them from going on strike due to their unmet needs reaching a critical level. Keeping their Morale high also tends to lead to your Diggles making more Diggles, and each new generation has higher skill caps, so it is recommended to do so.

The campaign is based around a series of quests set up via cut-scenes, with very sarcastic humour. The humour is very reminiscent of that which you will find in your typical game set in the Ardania universe (Majesty, Impire, etc) and this keeps the game very light-hearted. There is also a skirmish mode, but considering that the game is more designed around longer research trees, I can't see this ends up as anything other than two teams of five Diggles all pelting each other with slingshots, unless the two people playing agree not to fight for a long time.

Overall, I think the game is not as good as subsequent releases in the genre, with Rimworld providing more emergent storytelling opportunities, and Oxygen Not Included refining the side-on strategy formula and providing better gameplay mechanically with higher replayability. In spite of this, Diggles still stands up as a strong game from the genre due to it's tech tree, campaign, and it's humour, and for the price, I think it is worth a try.",1,1608156972,1103,0,1

So, anyway, I have a bit more experience with it than my number of hours on steam might suggest. And it also tells you I found the game worth buying again.

That said, be warned that everything isn't just slow, it's padded beyond belief.

For example, let's take making a grilled hamster. In a game like The Sims, someone would take the ingredients out of the fridge, go to the stove and cook it, done. In Diggles it goes like this:

- Diggle 1 stands around for like a quarter of a minute, scratches his head, slowly takes off his current hat and slowly replaces it with the delivery guy hat

- Diggle 1 goes and fetches the hamster, drops it by the fireplace

- Diggle 1 stands around scratching his head

- Diggle 1 puts back his ""no job assigned"" hat. Slowly.

- More standing around scratching head or rubbing eyes

- Diggle 2 scratches head, slowly replaces his ""no job assigned"" hat with the cook hat

- Diggle 2 makes his way to the fireplace and actually cooks the hamster

Any other job goes exactly like that too. With not just slow animations, but standing around and other padding too. And some might involve multiple deliveries, so add more standing around and padding in between each.",1,1625443408,1997,0,37
4589,1478650,"Liked this game as a kid, but replaying it isn't worth it even for nostalgia's sake.
The glaring issue of [b]W[/b]iggles is its AI:

1) Sometimes Wiggles will simply prefer standing around instead of doing tasks for no discernible reason.
2) Wiggles perform tasks in an egregiously inefficient manner, i.e. they walk a mile to chop down a mushroom, carry the trunk back to the production place, craft the item, walk back to the next mushroom and so on instead of just chopping all mushrooms down at once and carrying everything back to stash it.
3) Skills are learned by doing tasks and there are skill requirements for researching new tech, however it's not possible to change the task preferences of your Wiggles. They either only do manually assigned work (and most work cannot be manually assigned, you can't force a wiggle to craft an item for example) or do random work (or nothing as mentioned in point 1).

Additionally the game suffers from glacial pacing, which is magnified by the AI issues.

Back in the days one of the main selling points of Wiggles was the DUDE WEED sense of humor and the originality of vertical basebuilding. Now that you're no longer twelve years old the humor is cringe and you're better of playing one of the dozens other management sims on Steam or just Dwarf Fortress.

4591,1478650,"Wiggles (or Diggles, as it is called outside Germany) is a very old colony sim that predates Dwarf Fortress by a year but had already had many of the features that make DF so fun. This is not an improved version of that game but simply a port to run on modern systems.
Wiggles was one of my favourite games as a kid, I played it whenever I could. There was something appealing to me, it combined strategy, RPG and crude humour in such a way that found it a very enjoyable experience.

In this game you play as the Wiggles, a clan of dwarves which was tasked to get the pet dog of their god back, which has escaped deep inside a mountain and lives now in the underground. Your journey takes you through four different worlds and you have to overcome many difficult hurdles on your way. Too bad that your dwarves are completely imcompetent and prefer to do mischief chaos.
As you could have already guessed by the plot, this game does not take itself very seriously. It was designed as a parody of classic fantasy games. Take your dwarves for an example. They look more like garden gnomes than the typical dwarf you would expect. Your dwarves are clumsy, cheeky and always get themselves into problems. It is your job to keep them in check.

The game uses a 2.5 perspective for its gameplay. You see a cross section of the mountain with tunnels and caves located inside. You can order your dwarves to dig out new tunnels or carve out a section for a cave which gives you room to place buildings inside. Bigger caves take up more room and are ""deeper"", which means you can place buildings further back. The first building you always have is the fireplace which acts as the center of your civilization. On the fireplace you can cook basic food and also learn your first new buildings which you can also craft there. 
Buildings in Wiggles are placed first in crates for easier transport and can be ordered to be built anywhere they fit. This can be on the surface (if aviable), in natural or dug caves and even in tunnels if the building is small enough. The first aviable dwarf will carry the crate to the destination and start constructing the building. The best part about this is that you can easily dismantle buildings the same way and pack them back into crates. That way you can freely rebuild your structures somewhere else once you move your underground city or if you need more room.

Dwarves get experience points while they work. These can be for a lot of different things like woodwork, stonework, cooking, fighting and more. Doing a specific job often will specialize the dwarf over time in that job and this has a direct impact on the efficiency of the dwarf. A character with a lot of experience in stonework will dig out tunnels faster and spends less time with his pickaxe getting stuck in the ground (yes, this is a thing in the game). More importantly however is that dwrafes with experience can now do research. Every building has diffewent research subjects beginning from your fireplace and researching a subject allows you to craft the item or building that was researched. Through this system you will progress the technology of your civilization and get access to useful tools. That way you can learn how to build farms, better crafting stations, sleeping quarters, nw recipes and more. However, with the progress of civilization comes also new entitlement.
Your dwarves will now want more and better stuff, so you are forced to give them access to baths, living rooms, better beds and of course beer. Keeping your dwarves happy is important because unhappy dwarves refuse to do work but even worse, they refuse to propagate. Your dwarves can get children of their own if they are happy (and have the free time to ""wrestle on the ground"" with each other) and this is very important because older dwarves will eventually die. But there is another good reason to have kids and that is that kids inherit part of the experience of their parents. Not only that but they also have a higher experience cap, which allows them to get more max experience than their parents. Your generations will get better and better over time, which means that your civilization will get further progress.

The main campaign of the game is very story-centric. You will get quests and sidequests by reaching specific locations on the map. One thing that stands out here is that even though the campaign is always the same, the map is actually semi-randomized each time you start a new playthrough. There are story relevant structures that are always present but the details of the locations and the layoout of the map is always different. While this does not give a ton a of replayability it gives at least some reason to play it again. During your campaign you will have to solve puzzles, fight monsters and will also meet other dwarven clans who might help or hinder you. Doing all the quests is not necessary to win the game but often you get rewards for it. 

If you don't liek to play the story mode, there is also skirmish (although only vs computer enemies). In that mode you compete against other dwarven clans and each clan has their own specialities. The Wiggles are in this case the allroundr sthat are good at everything but don't excel at anything. The Knockers are more focused on tunneling and metalwork, the Peacers are good at producing food but suck at combat, the Brainies are good at research and technology and the Vampires are good at combat. The clans can still get all the technologies but each clan progresses faster or slower in their categories. Skirmish always is on random maps and you can decide on what Biome you want to fight.

What I really like about the game is that it has personality. There is a lot of humour in the game and it takes often jabs at tropes fantasy games. YOur dwarves are rude and complain a lot but they are also adorable dorks. You can often see them do all kinds of stupid shit in their free time and it is hard to stay angry at them. There are so many funny elements in the game that make no sense like the fact that your dwarves use big mushrooms as wood ressource or that you can use hamsters as mount (if you don't eat them first). There is a good reason why I lik this game so much.

However, I also want to point out the negative aspects and why the game didn't make the big jump back when it was first released. The AI can be very problematic at times and it only worsens the longer your game goes on. The main problem here is that your dwarves can get bored faster than they can fix their boredom which leads to a spiral of not doing work because they are unhappy which leads to other dwraves being unhappy since your workers didn't produce food or other needed goods. While this rarely leads to a complete death spiral like Dwarf Fortress, it can be frustrating when it happens. The AI can also have some other troubles, like pathfinding, sometimes the dwarves glitch weirdly around, get stuck on a tiny spot. A common problem is that it takes forever for dwarves to deliver items to crafting stations because they get distratced by anything. This can lead to the dwarf keeping the item in his inventory until you notice it and force him to clear it out.
The UI is also very basic but this is more a problem of it being a 10 year old game. The UI was not designed for modern resolutions and you notice that all the buttons are tiny and there is so much free space where they could have put more buttons. Controls are also very weird. When you come froma  different strategy game and play this you notice that none of the controls make any sense, worse yet, you also cannot rebind any of them. 
The graphics are obviously dated but still look colorful in my opinion. One thing they did good is that the faces of the dwarves are basically ""drawn"" on the model, so they could have animated facial expression. This looks still good even today.
Overall this is a good game, so check it out.

4592,1478650,"Very surprised Diggles/Wiggles has appeared on Steam, but VERY happy it did!

This is an unique game; nothing really compares to it then (20 years ago), and since then no game has been published (to my knowledge) that comes even close to it.  So i almost immediatly bought it (again).

Didnt play Wiggles for years as the original sadly wasnt compatible with 'newer' Windows-version. (Could play the official Demo a bit longer though.)
Although graphics is a bit outdated and gameplay is quite slow, the game concept is so good, it was and still is the best game i ever played. 

The game is now far more stable then the original, and all is running more smoothly (but that probably is due to a much faster processor).

Don't know if people from SEK-Ost are still involved in the game, but if so, my special thanks for developping this game in the first place!

Wiggles is absoluty recommended!

4594,1478650,"A classic game from Germany, with a nice controversy around the band ""Wiggles"": The band didn't want to be associated with these coarse, substance-abusing dwarves, so they had to rename the game to ""diggles"". 

In the game itself we have to guide a tribe of dwarves through several large levels on their way to re-store the chain of fenris, and ultimately subdue the beast. It has a 3d environment viewed from the side. The dwarves have their own abilities (and a maximum score of it), lifespan and demands to be served. If you don't fulfil their demands, they might go extinct

 While it was quite innovative for its time (the only somewhat similar game was the Creatures series, which didn't have combat), the controls are rather unresponsive and sometimes complicated for todays standards.

4603,1478650,"Okay so the game is from 2001. And the review section is all abuzz? Why? Well, it's a great game, plain and simple and it was unprecedented at the time and still today. 

This game was one of the first to use the side view in a 3D environment. So is this a virtual ant farm? Yes, in a way. But you get to tell your ants - ahem - pardon me, dwarves what to do. They're snarky, they're funny, they're tough, they have babies...There is a bunch going on. 

The mechanics are easy to pick up and master. You decide what you want to focus on: do you want to be the explorer, the architect, the warrior? You decide. 

The game was first released in 2001, but it really doesn't show. The graphics have been upgraded and I have played almost 3 hours without a stutter, bug or crash (those who have the physical version will know that is a massive upgrade - heh), PLUS it runs as soon as you hit play (le gasp!). 

[i]To those who have no history with this game, that is a BIG deal as it was playable under Windows 98, a bit iffy to get to work on XP and unplayable on everything after, in spite of the communities' best efforts. Fans really REALLY wanted to play this game again. And now they can!) [/i]

The cigar dudes are still a part of the game ;) Far out!

So in a nutshell:

[list]
    [*] there is an elaborate tech tree
    [*] the levels are enormous and partially randomized
    [*] every generation of dwarves is better than the prior ones, they have more skill points and even inherit some from their parents
    [*] embedded in a story but fully open world 
    [*] funny dialogues and characters
    [*] cute cartoon stlye
    [*] runs solidly without any issues, just hit play and off you go down the dwarf hole
    [*] bugs from the physical version have been fixed
    [*] graphics have been upgraded and are nice to look at

If you can get past the dated graphics, the style and mechanics offer a certain feel that other subterranean colony builders such as Craft the World just didn't manage to capture. Its like an ant farm that you design, but its filled with dwarves that are slightly more amusing to watch than the ants that you would have originally used to fill the farm in real life.

Your dwarves gain skills, find partners, pass on their skills to their kids and actually die after a while. A usual dwarven life lasts approximately 12 real time hours, and before you finish the campaign you WILL have gone through several generations of dwarves. [spoiler]Though if you got favourites, you will quite possibly means to keep them alive. So no worries on that end.[/spoiler]
You will also have progressed from what is basically the stone age to the future ages with guns, hoverboards and frikkin' laser swords.

Has some nice, unique ideas, like being able to pack up your buildings and even requiring you to do so as you travel deeper and deeper, visiting various biomes. This is also quite handy if you wanna do a good cleanup of your settlement - just leave behind what you don't need anymore.

It took me 50h to finish the main campaign and 20 more hours to finish all the alternative quests for achievements.

4681,1478670,"So after purchasing the game i was thinking whether to recommend it or not. The reason i have is simply because of the price. Which for the price right now £2 it's worth a try.

I see a lot of potential in this game and could become a great way to relieve stress but right now the physics of the game arn't up to scratch. Everything feels sluggish. Trying to throw things especially the small bottles is a nightmare. They barley go a few feet. I was playing on oculus rift s and while the tracking isn't perfect on the rift it should be okay to throw a few things around.

The sound effects in the game arn't very satisfying. You smash a statue and it kinda sounds like you've just crushed a small plastic toy. It doesn't have the impact i'd like.

The movement is quite annoying also. When grabbing the grips to make a fist to punch things instead it moves you around which just isn't that great. I'd like it to only do that if i hold onto walls not the air.

Some of the weapons are pretty buggy like the bow i loved shooting the bow it felt great but when i dropped the bow it vanished but i still had a floaty arrow in my hand.

Overall with a bit of love this game could be awesome and worth more than the price but right now the price is definatly an indication of quality. I have played 25 minutes of the game and got bored already without unlocking any of the cool stuff but because of how the weapons feel i don't have a urge to unlock them cuz i know they wont handle well. Take guns for example when shooting things with a gun it either leaves a small scratch on tough objects or makes smaller objects just disappear. So i have no desire to unlock the AK cuz i know it'll do the same just abit faster.

For the current price it is fun for 30 minutes so worth it in my opinion. But i would recommend waiting for a couple updates to fix the bugs and make the game feel more reactive",1,1633007646,25,0,56

A neat little gem, still too rough to be thoroughly enjoyed. Nice presentation, the weapon/area selection is nice and the destruction isn't half-bad but it's sorely lacking in good controls.

I literally cannot enjoy this fully because the controls are so terrible. It doesn't even have smoothturn or walk and somehow you can't one-hand a melee weapon properly, like it always expects you to go two-handed. Teleport or grab based movement atm.

There is no goals, no real missions, just a lot of weapons to unlock by reaching various goals. Give the small price you are paying you do just about get what it is worth here. Yes, it’s glitchy as anything else I have played before it and no it is not exactly original, but it delivers a small amount of mindless fun for a small price and you can’t say fairer than that.",1,1633006761,19,0,282

Things I didn't like, weapons were weightless so it was extremely awkward trying to smash something and I understand how ridiculously hard the physics would have to be in the gane for it in VR but I can't help it, it's awkward and hard to smash things.

Taking a piss and crap on things so awesome! Hahaha

It's alright I hope the physics can be fixed and breaking things are automatically loaded so when you break it, its breaks the same way if that makes sense. Like if I were to take a chainsaw to something it would automatically fall apart instead of sawing through it. 

If updates are going to be made I'm all! in if not ehhhh maybe not. Fun 1 or 2 times that's it.",1,1633195657,153,0,84

Sometimes you take damage just walking around, sometimes your held item decides it wants to drag you across a room, stuff swings slowly, in many cases too slow to do damage, and your held items can just randomly break on you.   

I've had held items break in my hands before the level loaded, loading me into the level with nothing.

Now I'm already at the point that its just reset a few more times to get the last couple achievements.

Stutter! One of the end goal perks is auto aiming and destroying at asteroids by hit keys on the keyboard instead of clicking them, very satisfying and feels great at first. Shame it only shows up at the very very late game. BUT after keyboard killing asteroids for a while the game develops a stutter. When I go to destroy asteroids with either the mouse or keyboard I get little half second freezes every 1 to 2 seconds.

4712,1478000,"Pros:
- Very detailed bus. From the exterior to the interior. Very nice texture. Very realistic sound. The dashboard is very beautiful.
- Lots of options and versions to choose from.
- Very realistic IBIS and ticket printer.
- Lots of repaints to choose from.
- Very cheap (Especially considering all the options and versions you can choose).
- Everything feels very nice and well made.
- Can adjust the mirror and the steering wheel to personal liking.

Cons:
- There are a few minor bugs.
- Not low computer spec friendly since it is very detailed.
- No blinker sound.
- People exit through the first door. They also enter through doors other than the first door as well.

In my opinion, this add-on is a must have if you enjoy playing OMSI 2. It feels very well made and not done in a hurry. I can feel the developer actually put the effort into making this add-on. Both the texture and sound are very nice. There are many different setvars and versions to choose from. This add-on is even better than the hamburger buspack and E-MB. All the buttons in the driver's place have a function and they all work (Unlike the hamburger buspack). Plus, it is very cheap considering all the versions and setvars it comes with. If i have to choose between the hamburger buspack or this add-on, I would 100% choose this add-on over the hamburger buspack since this add-on is more detailed than the hamburger buspack.

However, there are some downsides. Since the buses are very detailed, the performance is quite bad. My computer can barely keep up to 30 FPS while driving at Berlin Spandau. My computer specs:
- i7-7700HQ
- GTX 1070
- 16GB DDR4 Ram
I also have no idea why there is no blinker sound (The ticking sound when the blinkers are on) when i turn on the blinkers. I prefer some blinker sound so that i know my blinkers are on. I disliked that fact that they can enter through doors other than the first door and can exit through the first door. I wish they can only enter through the first door and can not exit through the first door.


TL;DR:
It is a must have if you enjoy playing OMSI 2. It is very well made, cheap (Especially considering for all the versions and options it comes with) and very detailed. However, it requires a fairly powerful computer in order to run smoothly. Long story short, I strongly recommend you buy this add-on.",1,1606866478,0,0,2

You might die a hundred times before you are finally reunited with the attack helicopter. It's such a tense experience my hands hurt after a while and I couldn't get a good grip on the keyboard any longer because of the sweat. But you have unlimited tries and most stages take less than two minutes to complete once you know what you're doing. When you are triumphant you are rewarded with the option to proceed to the next level and try your very best again and again in a completely new stage.

I highly recommend picking this up, especially if you manage to get it on sale for 1-2 bucks. It's amazing to see HaDe Games publish more and more indie games by developers that put hundreds - if not thousands - of hours and vast amounts of heart blood into their work.",1,1610140028,96,0,6

4733,1478120,"[h1]The Most Convincing Fast Jet for FS2[/h1]

The Hawk is beautifully detailed, inside and out, with textures that convey years of service. Flight is exhilarating, especially low level sorties following the contours of the land, for example through the alpine valleys of Innsbruck, then pulling up and rolling to cross ridges inverted, or flying impromptu aerobatics over the airfield. Sound is a subjective matter, but to me she sounds great. The instrumentation all appears to work, including both the fuel gauge and oxygen level indicator, which deplete as the flight progresses until ultimately the fuel warning light illuminates, although  I couldn't get it to actually flame out despite flying around on zero fuel for quite some time. Even he cabin altitude indicator reads correctly. Landings demand concentration to bleed the speed of the slick aircraft down to 190 kts on downwind and 130-140 kts on final approach, but speed brakes are available if required. 

There are a few issues. The trim pitch trim caught me out initially as it functions differently to other AF aircraft, as the trim channel does not directly control the trim but rather operates as a switch the can leave the trim as it is, trim forward, or trim back. The rate of travel of the pitch trim makes it difficult to trim accurately for level flight; a rate of about 1/4 of what it is currently set to would be better. As another reviewer has noted, there is no HUD, so you have to use the very adequate and realistic cockpit instrumentation. Unfortunately the VOR/ILS does not appear to work. And some of the buttons on the configuration menu panel, such as the ones to show or hide the pilots and joystick don't seem to have any effect. Nothing that really matters, but if a button is not implemented then it should at least be removed from the panel! One puzzling omission from the manual is the aircraft operating speeds. However she seems comfortable at the speeds of the real-life Hawk: rotate at 120-130 kts (flaps mid), approach at 130-140 kts (full flap), over the threshold at 110-115 kts (full flap).

Most rpg maker games ( im assuming thats what engine this is ) get flack for being bland and boring and re using the same things over and over again. You will find none of that here. 

What you will get is a unique battle system which forces you to use your turns in battle wisely. You may need to focus up and charge your magic points which take up a turn to charge. Or you may need to heal your hp rather then attack. You may also want to buff which uses spell charges as well. There are special attack for each class which  normally cost a lot of mp to use so you may want to store enough mp to deal a lot of damage. No matter what you choose the order of which you do it in will matter so think before you choose. 

The game also has a pretty unique level system where each class can beat a boss up to 2 times which will level that class up 2 times. There is no exp in this game so it's your only way to get stronger. You need life stones to resurrect bosses to beat them again. Money management is key here you will want to be stocked up on both potions and life stones. Anything else besides that only get if you have the extra cash to do so.

4737,1478180,"I really liked this game for a multitude of reasons nobody cares about and I recommend it wholeheartedly but gushing reviews are useless to other people, so I'm going to instead list potential deal breakers.

A few reviews make mention of humor and dialog but there's not much in this game. There's actually only enough story to get you going then the game steps back and lets you do your thing undisturbed. The dialog that does exist is pleasant enough and while a few lines of lore are scattered across some bookshelves, I didn't feel I needed more story than what was given. If you're expecting some sprawling saga, a speaking protagonist, memorable characters, or love exposition, you won't get that here.

The game captures the zenlike repetition of something like Monster Hunter where you repeatedly hurl yourself at the same boss which is an advertised feature but everyone is given very few tools to do this. The combat is extremely streamlined. Your attacks can't miss, the boss can't miss, you won't be juggling tons of skills and learning roshambo buffs and debuffs. And unlike Monster Hunter, you will find yourself trekking back to town to change class after fights. The developer provides teleportation between the front of dungeons and the bosses (thank you), but you will still spend a dozen or so seconds doing a meditative walk back and forth.

The developer was responsible by putting a warning at the start of the game but there is a great deal of screen flashing during combat. It's not necessarily any more than can be found in your average RPGM game and definitely not gratuitous or deliberately harmful but because all the battles take place in a black void, it's can be fatiguing on the eyes. I found myself blasting my room lights and wearing computer glasses to get through some of my loot farming runs where every single attack was flashing the screen.

Very fun graphics, always loved that 8-bit style. The soundtrack created such a cool atmosphere with all the different town themes and boss fights that kept me dialed in the whole time. All the animations for your character and boss attacks are insanely cool and extremely well done. 

In the game you can freely choose between five different classes while you adventure through the map, follow the story and fight boss battles. 
The boss combat is this super cool turn-based style where you have to prioritize your turns to charge up you stronger attacks with mana or get off a quick attack or use a potion to keep you alive. All while you have this awesome music and cool animations going off.
You can level up your character twice on each boss and after you defeat them you get a chance of some loot to drop.
Also found it cool that whenever you leveled up one character, all your other classes would get a certain stat buff. I recommend trying to level up all your classes along the way because you'll need as much as help as you can get stat wise for the final fight!

The game also has some fun humor in it so I found myself trying to talk with all the NPCs and laughing at what they said.

4749,1478180,"The premise of this game is that instead of being about a party of 3-5 characters who journey the world together and who have individual strengths that complement each other, this is about 1 (silent, nameable) character who can act as each of 5 classes by changing outfits outside of combat. There are Fighter, Priest, Wizard, Ninja and the comparatively lame Civilian. Each time you level up as a specific class, it upgrades a certain stat across the board. The contrast between these approaches is a topic of discussion in the story: there's a party of 4 characters that seem to be the definitive Adventurers Of The Realm that go on adventures parallel to your character. Shortly after meeting them, the Elder of the starter town gives them an admonishment for being too dependent on each other with a spiel that, e.g. if everyone could heal themselves to some degree then there would be a lighter load on the Priest. I'm not entirely sure I agree that self-reliance is inherently better than relying on others but it's an uncommon theme to base a game around and not a bad one. It’s good when a game works with it’s core mechanic as a story element, it helps the story and gameplay feel like both part of one experience rather than disconnected.
 
The main problem with the game (and why I dropped it) is that despite the good ideas, what the core gameplay boils down to isn't very interesting. Each of the 4 main (non-Civilian) classes have a total of 3 special moves each, most of which you cannot use at the start due to MP restrictions. The options you end up having are using your standard attack on the enemy repeatedly or meditating (read: defending) for 1-2 turns to build up enough MP that you can use a stronger attack that does 2-3 times more damage. The latter strategy is slightly better because it means you're defending for a few turns and enemies with higher Defence take more damage from 1 big hit than 2-3 smaller ones. This leads to a gameplay loop that just isn't very fun to play and the lack of different moves afforded by different classes at the start ends up selling the core mechanic of “changing class” short since all 5 play the same. You just rest, rest again and attack (and chug potions when your HP gets low) over and over until the enemy dies instead of you. It gets more tedious because you're encouraged, almost required, to fight previous enemies to level up and improve your abilities. There are no mooks in this game so when you grind, it's against a boss you've already beaten that you revive using a Life Stone. Not far out of the starting gates, you're directly told by an NPC to go back and fight the previous enemy 4 more times so that you can level up in each class to stand a chance against the next boss. This is a lot of repetition, especially for early on.
 
I had a few smaller issues with this game: 
[list]
[*]the ""go home"" shell didn't work. There's a consumable item that resembles a shell that teleports you back to your hometown of [Island-Town] when used but I couldn't get it to work. It says in the inventory description that it cannot be used in combat, which is understandable but I also tried using it in: The Ice Castle, Ore Town, the overworld near Ore town, and the overworld on the island that [Island-Town] is and it still didn't work. 
[*]boss HP is not visible. This is something that comes as default with RPGmaker and it's certainly not the only game to not have this, but in this case it means that the player can't tell if they lost by a large margin (so probably need to level up one of their classes) or just by a bit (so they don't, and just need to up their strategy) which is a pain
[*]number of remaining potions in the inventory is not visible in combat. This isn't something that is default for RPGmaker so I don't really know why it wasn't included. Maybe they forgot in the transition to the new battle interface, but it’s a pain for similar reasons as above. It really feels like you should be able to keep track of this, especially when money isn't abundant. These 2 reasons make it really hard to see when your or your enemies death is imminent, yours by running out of potions and then getting killed in 3 turns, theirs by running out of HP
[/list]

The story premise and setting isn't going to win any awards for uniqueness but I'd say that it has enough charm and good presentation to it to make it work. The art style is very good (though the main character's Peace Sign animation was a little odd) and the sound design is great. The interface in battle functions the same as standard menus, but makes it just feel better than a bunch of menu boxes. I think the battle interface demonstrates my feeling towards this game: great presentation, functions little different to normal, but when it comes down to it, somewhat repetitive.  It's a shame that this spoils it for me, but maybe other experiences are different, some people might not mind this repetition, I unfortunately do.
 
TL;DR: This game is charming, the presentation is good but the gameplay itself is rather repetitive. If you just came to read the TL;DR and not the rest of my review, this game probably isn't for you.",0,1685895141,104,0,3

A nice way to start off the New Year of Video games. The game play is challenging, the world is really cute with this Star Tropics vibe to it. The music stays in your head long after you stopped playing it.. in a good way... very very catchy. Not much to the story but it is not really what you are playing this game for. The game has no overworld battles which is interesting and I was glad for it. The boss battles can be long but they were long for me because I didnt realize the level cap was 20 so I was grind leveling the bosses as they appeared and I didnt need to do that because there are more bosses than the level cap. I will say though the citizen is weaker for quite awhile and benefits from the levels of the other classes considerably. I do not think there is a wrong way to play it though. 
 
Money is tight till you get a bit further so you have to mind your cash. I usually only spent money on stones to fight the bosses again. The further you go though the items can sell for a bit and then money will not be a problem.
 One of the nice things they added for people is late in the game there is a dragon like creature that can reset all the bosses  for you. Everytime you fight a boss they get a little stronger. The can reset them all a max of 3 times. I didnt need to do that with how much I leveled up but I can see this helping a lot of people who didn't grind I guess you'd say as I did. 
 I do feel like I played it in hard mode and I was not disgruntled by this fact because the combat was fun. I think because the fights strategy wise could take awhile they were smart not to add overworld combat. I think that would have drawn it out too much uneccessarily. 
 
If you want a bit of nostalgia with challenge that wont take 100 hours to get through id recommend this game. I hope more people will play it since it does not have many reviews. I will be looking in the future to see what this developer comes up with next. Keep at it your game was really fun. I can see myself downloading it again in the future and doing a boss fight just for fun or walking across the game world just to hear the music.
 
P.S The game did have some flashing lights a lot in the intro mainly. There are some in a few of the boss fights but I was able to get through it and not be in agony like some other games. I was worried when I saw the warning in the intro and when I first played it I did have some struggle because of the lightning but was able to get through it. 

P.S.S To the game developer. The clothesline idea I absolutely loved for the class change and the citizen with his victory was really adorable I hope you keep with this style design wise just of course less flashing lights for us older weak eyed people.  Oh and keep the same person you used for your music it was such a perfect fit for the world you created. ^_^",1,1675190985,1535,0,58

No random encounters, purely optional grinding for gear, a bunch of classes, levelling up different classes boost each other, lending to unique synergies, all abilities tightly balanced. A nice treat, from start to finish.

My only complaint would be that sometimes you're working away at the boss's hp and it feels like you're whacking a statue because you have no idea how much HP they have left. You can get an item later in the game that can scan their HP. Once you've beat a boss once you roughly know their HP if you were keeping count in your head,  but but before that I was just keeping track in my head how much damage I've dealt. Also I wish SPEED was a more important to other classes and bosses asides from just the Ninja. These are extremely minor nitpicks in an otherwise flawless game though.

4755,1478180,"This is a retro-style RPG with grinding baked into its very nature. 8-bit style graphics, and very well-done chiptune music and sound effects. I was instantly engaged by this because I am a gaming dinosaur.

The story is a light twist on your whole ""nobody becomes hero, saves the world"" trope, as you're not the hero - at first. You follow in the shadow of a party of renowned heroes, and the leader makes it clear that you're in their way. You start to make a name for yourself, by becoming a one-man army, combining the strengths of all classes into one, in a very tactical (and for most of my early-to-mid-game experience, very defensive) turn-based combat system in which the only enemies are bosses. There are no random trash encounters.

You defeat bosses to level up whatever class you kill them as (two levels per class per boss). Each class gets stronger as they level, but they also share benefits across classes, such as extra stat gains and sharing certain abilities from their toolkits. Think something akin to the Jobs system in various Final Fantasy titles. This is not only neat, but mandatory to get anywhere with the fights. If you're not combining abilities, you're going to have a bad time.

For those curious, since I've mentioned them a dozen times so far, the classes are:
-Citizen: your default and starter class. Fists only. Starts weak, begins to feel like a badass monk as you progress.
-Soldier: Uses swords. Heavy focus on Attack and Defense stats. Straightforward bruiser.
-Priest: Uses tomes. Has the only healing spell, and can hold his own in damage.
-Ninja: Uses claws. Relies on Speed stat for his heavy-hitting ability. The ""Boost"" ability is amazing for MP regeneration.
-Wizard: Uses staves. Big damage, and the only Defense-boosting ability in the game (which is basically mandatory to ward off many bosses' big-hitting attacks).

It's a game for a certain kind of broken individual. You're gonna be killing each and every boss at least 10 times for full class level-ups, and probably a lot more to farm their loot pools, which expand as your Luck stat increases. Unless I misread the developer's intention, it lends itself heavily to save-scumming to make sure you get the exact loot you want from your boss kills. They get a little stronger each time you kill and revive them.

Money is tight for the beginning of your adventure, but it gets better later on. Two NPCs will prevent you from getting stuck due to money. If you are out of money, you can get help by talking to:
-Logan in the starter town will give you healing potions if you're out and can't afford more.
-Sturgis in the second town will give you a Life-Rock (the item needed to revive bosses) if you're out and can't afford more.

You'll find yourself somewhat reliant on potions until you can Heal and Boost, then potions seem basically unneeded.
[Full disclosure: I've been playing RPGs since the early '90s and have always found items to be a crutch that I go out of my way to avoid leaning on] 

I'm 25 hours in, and not yet through with the main story, as I am an obsessive grinder. A straightforward playthrough without all of the reloading and repeating I've been doing could probably have fully beaten the game and gotten all achievements at this point. But for me, there are still things I haven't seen, bosses I haven't fought. I'll get there just as soon as I get the last couple drops I need for my collection from the early bosses.

The Legion of Maelstrom is a strong blend of modern and retro, in a package that's both easy to walk away from, and easy to spend hours getting lost in, just trying for that one drop (I'm looking at you, Predator Claw). If your tastes combine Dragon Warrior/Quest with soul-crushing repetition, pick it up.

I'm a complete noob solo game dev, and I was thinking to myself, ""damn, I wouldn't have bothered with that."" Loved that music room! I'm not much of a story person, but I actually really liked where it went. Loved that ending scene! Oh, and the animations, sound effect, for the moves were really good. Great pixel arts. The music too, head bopping. 

If I may add some ideas, and I don't know if this is in the game or not, but it would have been nice if I could have spent my in-game money on an upgraded battle scanner that reveals the enemy's HP at all times. 

I would have also liked it if the player were able to random crit the enemy, as well as gain random buff (dodge, MP regen, no MP cost on skill, increased MP refill, etc), to make the battle dynamic, as by the time I fought the gold shard enemies, it kind of became a battle of endurance with their high HP, and in my mind, I kind of thought of it like when I played Skyrim, and I would hop on a rock and, as a low level archer, shoot a lot of arrow at a giant that couldn't quite get me, and in the context of this game, basically had to, every now and then, hop down from the rock to collect all my shot-arrows, hop back up on the rock, and repeat.

Also, I think you should move/remove the chests at the end boss, and just have one of the story-NPC give it to you when that area becomes accessible, as I completely ignored that area, choosing to level my classes instead, heading to that area only after I felt ready, only to find all these useful things there, would have really loved having those items beforehand!

It's a bit short and most of the puzzle are not very meaningful, but they are also quite easy, so it's hard to get stuck or frustrated. Despite a couple of sections that felt a bit too long, the game is incredibly well-paced and fun to play.
The story is a little bit perplexing and I am not sure if I got all of its implications, but I found the writing to be competent and very evocative, giving a good texture to every character.
Together with the writing, the visuals and the music bring in a strong sense of saudade that permeates the whole game and really strikes you deep. The music, in particular, is hauntingly beautiful.
Overall, I feel that it lacks a little bit of polish, but The Wormaid is a strange and strong experience that I can recommend to everyone, even people not too much into puzzle games.

4772,1477640,"I wanted to like this game, but I can't recommend it in its current state.

I played this game after watching a critique of it and liking the idea of a game which is brutally difficult, time-bound, and allowed for different classes for your own experience. The game is brutally difficult, but not in a fair way, its just blatantly unbalanced at quite a few points. The initial premise is that the world is being overrun in water, and people and monsters are fighting for the last few scraps of land that remain, you as the hero, are trying to find a solution. That said let's go over the individual points.

[b]Sound 8/10[/b]
The sound is what drew me to this game over anything else. The ambient sounds in particular fit so well with the theme of the game. The idea of sailing around looking for the last vestiges of humanity on a time-bound game really appealed to me, and the soundtrack really nails this idea most of the time. The over world music is just fantastic. The battle music a little less so, but it has some really good points as well, notably it's boss battle music, although you hear it very infrequently through the game.

[b]Graphics 4/10[/b]
The Graphics are nothing to write home about. The opening screen is just a picture with some photo shop work done. The characters are all made using RPG Maker VXAce character creator, and there is no busts for the characters at all. I am not sure if there was any unique enemies, as I am not very well versed in VXAxe, but they seemed like they were all default and uninteresting other then possibly the final boss. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary other then standard VXAce artwork. The battle system also uses a front-view and the animations all are nothing to write home about or get excited about, no breathtaking action sequences which make you want to use those cool moves or anything.

[b]Gameplay 3/10[/b]
I wanted to like this game the most based on the idea of a brutally difficult retro-rpg which forces you to use your resources sparingly as everything you do is time-bound. The game has a timer which ticks while your on the overworld map, inside dungeons, and whenever you rest to restore your HP/MP. There is also a little variation of the NPC's depending on the time of day, its possible I missed a thing or two, but it mostly boils down to during the day the NPCs are at shops / around town, and they are in their homes at night. There doesn't appear to be any difference to combats based on the time of day, in fact on the overworld at night if you get into a battle its suddenly day in the combat.

The combat is brutally difficult, but its boring, the skills the characters get are very lackluster, and because every time you sleep, you lose time in the time-bound game, most of the time your just attacking, endlessly attacking, and running away from the unbalanced enemies. Save all your MP for healing, eventually you get into a loop where you get enough money to buy MP items to heal so you can keep grinding and not waste lots of time sleeping. Several of the enemies are massively more difficult then others, and do not give proportionate rewards. Overall the gameplay was not very enjoyable because of these things. 

[b]Story 3/10[/b]
I was really interested in the story premise. But, that's really all it is, a premise. The characters are all extremely flat, and there is actually very little dialogue. I found 3 of the 4 endings, with the final ending (i'm guessing the ""True"") ending I was unable to actually finish because the games hints are to vague to figure it out. I spent about 3 hours trying to find this last ending to no avail, even playing the ""story"" only mode to possibly find it, searching every nook and cranny, playing with the timed events, no luck. The endings do have character variations, and are mildly interesting, but they don't really resolve anything and are very short. Not really worth the effort of getting.

[b]Overall Opinion[/b]
Overall I was very disappointed by the game. I wanted to like it, and I gave it the good old college try, but until the balancing is fixed, they spruce up the characters to make them feel more interesting, and do a better job leading the player towards the next objective, this game is a hard pass!",0,1617584975,449,0,13

Seriously though, very bad controls and its just here to waste time. would have been kind of fun if there was some kind of AI that at least tried to hunt you but instead it's literally get too close, die, or be unfortunate enough to get hit by a dino that is running in circles.

That makes it more confusing why they didn't manage to carry out the ideas here to make a larger experience. Padding, or collecting 20 coconuts instead of 8 wouldn't be better, it was already wearing thin at 8. But changing the size of the map, scaling the camera back and the speed at which you move would feel more engaging in my opinion. Adding some decoration object like flowers would only be a few extra pngs, but could stretch the impact of bringing back life to an area. 
Adding some visual information outside the collection bird's menu could feel rewarding. Since there is automation towards the end of the game, you very well could add way more scaling than 7 water plants and 8 land plants. Given more goals, without even adding much more content.

Simply saying 'find a way out' is not enough for people to understand what is needed to even do that...

4840,1476950,"Planetary Control! gives a good first impression, then drowns in an ocean of flaws.

By the makers of Kerberos (makers of Sword of the Stars, one of my favorite 4X games ever) comes a card game set in the universe of SOTS, though this relation is relegated to a very brief intro and the game itself having zero story content.

The game revolves around five planets. As a space warlord, you are given a variety of cards scored 1-9 that can be used on a certain one of the five planets.  You use these to conquer said planets; put up a card or a combination of cards higher than the score occupying the planet, and you successfully conquer it. The defeated army then become civilians, adding a passive 'score' to the planet that makes the world more valuable over time. Once one player draws the Ceasefire card, every player gets one more turn, then the round ends. The score of all the armies and civilians are added up, and the person with the highest score (or highest score over a set number of rounds) wins.

The concept is pretty simple. And at first, I liked it! It was easy to understand and play and the rounds go by relatively quickly. However, the more I played, the more I became acutely aware of the game's problems. Annoying at first, then intolerable. As it currently exists, this game is not something I can recommend.

The central gameplay loop is fine; where the problems come in are the other cards present in the game. I can't really explain why this game breaks down without describing them, so here they are:

Training, which lets you draw more cards
Espionage, which lets you force a player to discard cards
Reinforce, which lets you add a planet card to one you already own to reinforce it
Spy, which lets you steal cards from another player
Assassinate, which deletes a planet card on an occupied planet to weaken it
Colonize, which adds five civilians to a planet
Salvage, which lets you use any card from the discard pile
Nuke!, which lets you invade any planet, so long as you have an appropriate army to occupy it. This resets the civilian counter to 0 and completely wipes out the occupying army, no matter how strong it is.
Shields, which protects from nukes
Point Defense, which can be used when a player uses a nuke to shoot it down
and Sabotage, which destroys a shield

As you can see, some of these are pretty simple. But a *few* are so utterly and wildly broken that they can swing the entire momentum of a round simply by virtue of having them. There are a lot of board games out there that rely on chance, but Planetary Control! ramps it up to 11.

I'll give an example.

You have two planets. You suspect your opponent has enough cards to take one of them, but you're also confident you have enough to take it back should they do so. You let them conquer the world, then spend all your planet cards taking it back. Then a third player nukes it, making all these gambits a waste. This isn't just limited to the nuke card: almost every single special card in the game seems to be designed in such a way to punish planning ahead.

This is Planetary Control's fatal flaw: it does [i]not[/i] reward long-term thinking, which is [i]sort of important[/i] for a strategy game.

This wouldn't be [i]so[/i] bad, if it weren't for the fact that the in-game deck is absolutely saturated with these special cards. They're not some special rare things you'll get lucky to draw once; the game is absolutely teeming with them. The nuke card I mentioned? You'd think that'd be a big dramatic card used maybe once a round, but no, there's at least four or five of them in the deck and I suspect more. I've seen turns go back of players just nuking each other back-to-back, effectively wiping the board clean and making any previous moves a complete waste of time.

Every game, whether I've won or lost, felt almost entirely up to what cards I drew early on. There's literally [i]no point[/i] in formulating any kind of long-term plan when any of your gains are extremely likely to get wiped out the next turn. There's almost no way to insulate yourself against disaster, no way to form contingencies, no way to do [i]anything[/i] except throw yourself at the mercy of Lady Luck.

You can't strategically wait until you have a lot of cards to invade a planet, because it might and probably will get nuked, because there's so many nukes in the deck.

You can't holds your cards either, because they'll likely get stolen or discarded, because there's so many Spy and Espionage cards. You'll be in situations where you're using special cards not because it's a strategically sound decision, but just so [i]other players won't get to use them[/i].

You can't reinforce your planets without the reinforce card and having the luck of also having the appropriate planet card, so that's not a viable strategy either. 

Then there's the Salvage card, which is basically the I Win/You Lose card, for how you can use it to just instantly retrieve one of the OP special cards that you need most and instantly use it or cripple another player to a point they can't recover.

An analogy: imagine Smash Bros with all the OP items turned on Very High by default. Now imagine you can't change that.

Literally the best strategy I found was to ignore the entire first half of the round, and only then start using cards to conquer planets. When a valid strategy in your game is me [i]not playing it[/i], something has gone horribly wrong. I'd be more forgiving of all this if it let me edit the deck in some way to alleviate these problems, but since I can't, I can only assume the devs believe the current layout is the optimal one. It's not.

It just doesn't work. You feel cheated when you lose, you feel unworthy when you win. 

Every sandcastle eventually gets swallowed by the sea, but this game takes a perverse pride kicking yours over as soon as you lift the bucket. No thanks.",0,1646944821,494,0,114
4841,1476950,"Nice quick card game. At first i did not realise i could play a group of same cards to attack a planet. Sometimes you don't get many or at all special cards but you can still win or gain points if you wait and attack planets later. The main deck you and the Ai draw from won't refresh if exhausted. There is a end game card somewhere in the deck which can sometimes play at the right time when you control a number of planets and the last round is played before the game ends. Much like a white flag is a motor race. You can increase pop on planets to get bonus score points in two ways, having several armies/cards invade at once and playing a reinforce card if you get one. You can only attack a planet once per turn. 

It would be nice if there was more variety in enemy avatars and possible planets. As a tip, turn off the voice sfx in audio settings if you find the out of place voice annoying as i did. 

So in summary, once you learn to play this game and the rules are simple (no tutorial but some rules you can read), this is a game you could play to kill some time between other things.

4843,1476950,"A ""strategy"" title with no real strategy.

I was iffy anyway since most card game adaptations have disgusting reliance on random chance to win, but here it was especially bad.

You won't really understand unless you play it, but it is very irritating to be sitting on big armies of one of the species but you can't reinforce their planet without a special card you may or may not draw.

It's very annoying to actually have the biggest army only to lose it to a nuke card that someone may or may not draw.

It makes my mouth froth thinking about when I have a decent number of army cards and a nuke, but the enemy has a shield card in play and I don't have a sabotage...

There are too many hard counter situations that rely on pure chance card draws to counter for this to warrant any semblance of being a strategy game. It's chance, pure and simple, and what may work in a tabletop setting among friends doesn't sit right with me online. I'm not having fun...

There is something more, though. Kerberos? Let's chat...

Did you really need to crib Sword of the Stars' music for this game? I like SotS' music, honest, but if you're going to ""borrow"" from your glory days, could you at least let the whole track play? Hearing the Tarka battle theme in the menu would be a banger...if you let it actually drop. Hearing the buildup part contantly was literally just blue-balling...

Also...Kerberos? I get it. You guys like to have fun! I remember when I came across the ""normal view"" gag in Sword of the Stars. I genuinely laughed my backside off. But! Was it appropriate to have the announcer voice say ""hurry up"" every thirty seconds? 

Maybe, I dunno...I'm making some frickin' coffee and don't want the bare bones garbage game I'm ashamed I paid 5USD to ""play"" insulting me for spending my time making a frothy, caffeinated beverage?

Mistakes were made. You did a bad job making this, I paid money for this, Steam is selling it...I know, I know. I still love SotS but, maybe you can do better in the future, Kerberos.",0,1704468954,34,0,78

Starship Turd Nugget takes the gaming world by storm with its unexpected twist on the classic spaceship shooter genre. This zany and downright hilarious game offers a unique and entertaining experience that will leave players in stitches while still delivering solid gameplay mechanics.

From the moment you launch into space, you'll notice the unconventional enemy at your hands - poop! Yes, you read that right. But don't let the absurdity fool you; this game is an absolute blast (no pun intended).

Graphics and Design:
The developers have done an exceptional job creating a visually stunning space environment. The Starship Turd Nugget is creatively designed, and the vibrant colors add to the overall lighthearted atmosphere of the game. The attention to detail in the poop projectiles is surprisingly impressive, with different shapes and sizes that add an extra layer of humor to the game.

Gameplay:
Starship Turd Nugget provides a refreshing take on the traditional space shooter. The controls are intuitive, allowing for seamless navigation through asteroid fields and enemy waves. The inclusion of various power-ups and upgrades keeps the gameplay engaging, and the strategy involved in using shots as your primary weapon adds an unexpected layer of complexity.

Soundtrack and Effects:
The game's soundtrack is upbeat and quirky, perfectly complementing the absurdity of the concept. Voice acting is impeccable

Humour:
The humour in Starship Turd Nugget is undoubtedly its strongest asset. The developers have managed to infuse every aspect of the game with laugh-out-loud moments, making it an excellent choice for those looking to unwind and have a good time. The witty one-liners, humorous animations, and unexpected twists keep players entertained throughout.

In conclusion, Starship Turd Nugget is a triumph in combining unconventional humor with solid gameplay. If you're looking for a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and guarantees a good time, this is the one for you.

4851,1477050,"Very promising, if somewhat hardcore experience.  Not a game that will hold your hand.  No tutorial and steep learning curve.

UPDATE: (Developer has addressed many of my concerns with extreme difficulty by adding some very helpful features and by making many more options for difficulty selection.  He's basically addressed all the issues I had with the tough early game start (and with the game itself basically) Just wanted to thank him for his speedy and helpful reply - if only all devs were like him!)

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Took several hours and many failed builds to realize I needed more fighters and especially more higher HP characters, because you'll die - especially at the beginning - a lot.   Fortunately, healing and even resurrection is very cheap.

There are other challenges.  You need to recruit characters and get the right armor and weapons, and only a few are ever available at one time, and it can get frustrating when you can't get a match for your characters (as your characters begin with significant limitations like only heavy / composite / or light armor.  And only sword / mace / two-handed weapon / bow / composite bow) etc.  And new characters / weapons / armor etc. appear only every 7 turns.

You will need to skill up as quickly and thoughtfully as possible because you will need as many abilities as possible.  I recommend spreading these out among your four initial characters.  So one can 'read books', one can 'use potions', another 'use runes', etc.

And you will be limited to mostly basic attacks for quite some time, and your enemies, although they scale with you - will often be overpowering.  You need to save after every successful encounter (and make sure you are auto-saving every turn, which I believe is the default - and please to god, put your ego aside and play 'Easy' (the recommended setting) because it is plenty brutal.

Training is expensive and can only be in the abilities (3) that you begin with.  You will need at least 2 front-line fighters (make sure they are 1 and 2 in your order/squad list as that determines how you enter battle.
Then either 2 magic characters or one magic character and one archer.  Healers would also be ideal additions, but with only 4 squad members you really don't have enough slots to create a lot of variety.

And that brings me to my biggest criticism.  The difficulty can be punitive.  And much of it is up to luck (not just winning combat, but having the right options, choices, weapons/builds etc. go your way).

You will either be fighting or moving every turn and the battles will be with a cool range of creatures/animals/imaginary beings. To find them, you have to search each hex you go to until you've exhausted the list of places to explore. 

So the routine which has gotten my characters to LVL 4 in about 50 turns is this - fight, get loot, return to your main village square to heal, re-equip, re-recruit if you need to, get training etc., and then venture back out to fight some more so you can continue leveling up.  And hexes will be 'cleared' that is, no further places to explore after 7-8 places you've searched, so you really do need to keep moving to new hexes.  And the user interface while effective, doesn't hand-hold either.  For instance, don't try to just 'move' (right click somewhere) becausse you have to 'select your squad' first (don't ask me exactly why - but we're rolling 'old school' here.

I have yet to explore the 'building' aspect of the game and what it enables, but that's another issue - the place is glacially slow.  In those 50 plus turns I've taken about 6 tiles beyond my start.  Two to the NE (up to the mountains) and 4 or 5 - SW to the sea and a castle.  If you're seeking instant gratification, this is not the place.  If you like old school Turn Based Games, the HOMM franchise or the Disciples Series, then you will enjoy this.

I think of it as a more complex, more difficult follow-up to games like 'The Last Hex' that do hold your hand a bit more.  In fact, if I was not familiar with this type of game to begin with, I would have rage quit before getting as far as I have.

So it is a quality game, but an acquired taste.  Rewarding in the payoffs and successes, but also tedious and at times, seemingly difficult for no clear reason (such as the class/skill and armor/weapon limitations etc).

So it's a qualified recommendation and an encouragement to explore.  But only if you can be patient.  You will need several hours to even survive more than a few turns, so it is a 'slow burn'.

But honestly, I have enjoyed it so far and intend to continue... there is also a 'quest-line' that starts with exploring a Hermitage in the tile immediately to your South-West, but having not progressed very far in it I cannot describe it.

Note I've only got 6 hours 'official time' but somewhere between 7 or 8 before the 'time keeping bug' was fixed and playtime could accrue.   

It will take you at least 4-5 hours to get into the flow and begin to be successful, but if you can invest that time and enjoy hex based combat, it's worth a try.",1,1608604186,1335,0,52

4857,1477050,"Grim Wanderings 2 is a sequel to GW.
I first found GW on mobile, and the battle logic resembling Disciples universe did strike me right in my heart.

First, GW looked a bit oversimplified, but after a while, it turned out to be well balanced and pretty deep, and had high charge of replaybility.

Hence when I found it on PC (Steam) I got it. And was quite happy with it. It had a avant-garde dark theme and made it unique among other strategy turn based games.

I was surprised seeing this (GW2), and after a short hesitation, I bought it.

The world is much lively, strategically richer, with many new monsters and factions. 
Checkers board replaced with hex strategic world (resembling Eador).

Battles are well polished and now there is even movement allowed. The tactical battleground is not wide, so only few tactical movements are possible, but you still can hide your weaker units or hunt down enemy's rear spell casters if you slip through.

The number of skills and spell is high and you can combine them freely. There are like 15 races, and of course, not all get along too well, when in the same unit. 

What I like, is the option to teach any of your units skills and spells at training centers, and every of those has 3 tiers, the most expensive is of course most effective. Making the same necormancer on the same level a different unit, both in efficiency and skill set for example.

Every unit is capable to equip items and weapons or armor (for the two latter you must let the unit learn respective skill, which make it extremely good RPG)

There enough evidence, that devs did put much effort in the gameplay and as the game evolves, so do the quests, enemies and your own party. On higher levels you can finally move faster and solve much harder missions and win impossible battles. 

Combination of units and their skill does not allow EVERY skill to be maxed. And possibly some skills will be missing in your party totally. So some quests, that require lockpicking or stealth, would offer less options for you.  

Based on nature of the party you create, you will either have more social skills (persuasion, trade...) or more underhanded, like the lockpicking. 

What is new, is that you can basically attack NPCs - like towns and cities or guilds... and push your way through by force... despite I failed to create strong enough parties to do so, yet. 

The story in the adventure mode is well implemented, but the main goal is constant battle, one after another. 
You must keep you morale and spirits high, support your army with gold and food, and repair your equipment from time to time. Every city offers different spells to teach and you will find yourself immersed in a world that has it's own rules and concept and you will most definitely like it. 

What is also quite interesting: each race has different level-up stat increase scheme, so combine well with classes, as not every class goes well with every race. 
So far I found, that usually 3 unique races can cooperate with each other, so you should have wide spectrum of good combos without suffering morale drop.

There is an ""auto combat"" button if you don't want to bother with it at all, but where's the fun in that?

And having to buy a skill to drink a potion is just...weird. I don't get this one at all.

Anyway, if you can handle slower paced combat where you sometimes can't do anything useful for a turn or two, there is a lot to like here.",1,1630632982,143,0,89
4861,1477050,"Stumbled across this game.  Firstly graphics are good 2d but fit the game.  The learning curve can be quite steep but for me that was part of the fun.  The character development is quite extensive lots to do.  
Only played 3 hours on adventure mode (there is a strategy mode which allows building from what I can gather.
It is still EA so hopefully more to come and at this price it is a bargain, can see myself sinking many hours into this game.",1,1613696868,356,0,29
4862,1477050,"Worth it! Whether you are playing Adventure or Strategy, you are getting to play a great turn based RPG. 

There are so many more options to solve encounters rather than just being a murder hobo. I would even say it is the best strategy for the first bunch of turns until you get your 4 man party set. The combat itself takes place on a tight hex grid, but you get used to getting your party in the right place at the right time.

There are more gameplay mechanics still to come, at least as far as I seen in Strategy play. There is just soooo much you could do with this game with infinite development time. MP Strategy mode would be a great way to make and then lose friends in bitter defeats :) And multiple campaigns for Adventure mode would extend the replay value beyond its already ridiculous value (FUN/time+money). Maybe even slow down the pace of leveling, to make campaigns just for 1-7, 8-15, then high level play.

 This is where the BUT of the review comes in. This could be more mod friendly. I like the fact that each face for the race+class combinations change as they get more powerful, but those 4 pictures could be replaced with someones unique art. Even races or classes could be added in to extend the replay value. (Which, again, is already very high.) BUT, there is only so much time in a day, and a very small team has to make tough choices in regards to what they prioritize.

4863,1477050,"Quite a decent little game for the price.
It might seem initially hard, but once you start to get the hang of the damage mechanics and what kind of stats each char needs on his/her gear it becomes a lot easier.
For example the skills that you use will all use damage stat/s as a multiplier to determine damage done, these damage stats are Physical, Dynamic, Spiritual and Magic. So if the ability you're using has a 1.2 physical (120%) modifier then any Dynamic/Spiritual/Magic bonuses on your gear are completely unused. So it's always useful to check your abilities so you know what to look for in your gear.
In fact it's a good idea to check abilities in general, as initially my Adept was using an ability against Monsters that would initially lightly damage them, but was actually a heal over time.

The game also has a lot of randomness in its encounters, so you can effectively alter your difficulty by reloading to various degrees when it hits the fan ( and it will hit the fan a lot ). In fact I'd recommend regular saves just in case something especially bad happens ( unless you like that sort of thing ).

4865,1477050,"While Grim Wanderings 2 has some design issues, this lovechild of a an 80's turn-based-tactics tabletop, a 90's 4X strategy/management game and Choose Your Own Adventure has a lot to like for damn cheap.  The pop-up tutorials are juuuust barely enough to get you to figure out the basics, and there's little hand-holding, and there is a bit of a learning curve, even on Easy difficulty.  Getting past that, there is surprising depth and the gameplay loop is pretty satisfying.  

The good:
Each hex of the map has multiple features to interact with that can result in resources, rewards, or fights.
There is a decent variety of skills and classes and many combinations are workable.
You have a lot of latitude to interact with the world as you like-- plunder that farm?  Sure!
I like the CYOA-type list of choices with skill challenges and encounters.
Crafting items from resources is satisfying.
Resurrection is cheap.
The development team is still working to resolve what issues there are.

The bad:
The tutorial is inadequate and there are no guides available (maybe I'll write one).
The resource system is either not working right or is so non-intuitive that I can't figure it out.
I've experienced a bug where the music down and distorts in combat (frequent but not a huge deal) and a crash-to-desktop bug.
The user interface is non-intuitive.
Management of character happiness is never explained.

Bottom line:
If you want a mashup of Civilization 2 and old-school hex crawl RPGs where you can play as a Witcher or a Gnome assassin, it's absolutely worth a try.  Folks say it's hard and they're right, but you'll have the basics down in an hour or two.  That this was produced by a two person dev team is dang impressive.  If they smooth out the bumps, I'd pay twenty bucks for this title and be happy.  For six, it's an absolute steal.

But this game also has some...issues. For me, they are critical, so I can't bring myself to leave a positive comment. I leave a negative one hoping it will help developers fix everything in their next game. By now, I finished only one route (Cameron) from both Jace's and Hazel's perspectives and started Adrian's, so I will speak only about Cameron part. 

What's the issue?

Hazel's romance with Cameron is much more content. It includes more dates and casual meetings in different settings, more romantic interactions, and more chances for you to learn Cameron. For example, playing for Hazel, you will [spoiler]meet Cameron's mother, visit a restaurant that belongs to his family, learn about his plans for the future, his music preferences,[/spoiler] and so on. But Jace's route lacks everything. Yes, there is a reason for romance limits in Jace's route, the game explained everything well. But developers at least could add a little bit more events into his story to improve the dynamic and give us a chance to learn Cameron's background deeper from Jace's perspective as well!  

I played for Jace first and was very curious to know if Cameron really [spoiler]fights as rumors claim he would[/spoiler], but what do you think? I only managed to know it in Hazel route, not Jace. I mean, there was a mess because of all this [spoiler]fighting stuff[/spoiler] in Hazel story (not very detailed to tell the truth, but still a mess) while playing for Jace you get only a short dialog [b]without any specific details at all[/b]! Why? Why can't I learn more about the guy the game suggests me (or, Jace, to be precise) to date? Isn't it one of the main goals in such type of games?

Also, Jace's route ends rather fast. It is mostly true for the romantic ending.  As for the dramatic ending, it doesn't have drama at all. A few short-term conflicts, yes, but nothing too much emotional, exciting, unexpected or tragic. So why call this ""dramatic ending"" and confuse players? 

To sum up

I will repeat: it is still a good game. But it would be much more better, if developers could provide drama for dramatic ending and make Jace's route less imbalanced compared to Hazel's.",0,1716578387,791,0,3

4897,1477170,"I find myself a tad mixed on this game as a whole.  While it definitely has notable positives in my opinion it also has issues that make this game a lot less enjoyable in my opinion.

Pros
- Clearly takes inspiration from Advance Wars

- Tweaks the formula a bit by allowing the player to apply a certain number of perks to their units based on the map and these perks sometimes differ between the two major factions.

- The campaign's length is pretty good in my opinion when you consider how much this game costs to purchase.

Mixed
- Abilities are a lot easier to activate in this game than Advance Wars which is a blessing and a curse in my opinion.  This is because you gain points for activating your abilities from losing or destroying units.  And the points awarded for these units isn't influenced by their value like in Advance Wars.  As a result it's pretty easy for a human player to build so much advantage they just steam roll the enemy.  The game also allows you to earn points after you've activated an ability so it's pretty easy to activate some of your best abilities multiple turns in a row.

- The commanders for both of the major factions have set abilities instead of all of their commanders having unique powers.  As a result the various commanders are a lot less interesting to the player, but it does make it easier for the player to master a faction.

Cons
- The enemy is pretty easy to exploit at times since it will use it's best units to hinder capture attempts

- The overall difficulty of this game is rather low, as a result it's pretty easy for an experienced played to absolutely dominate the computer opponent's in this game which can make certain missions rather boring.

- The perks available to certain units aren't particularly well-balanced in my opinion.  This is especially true of the cavalry's ability to increase their movement range upon ranking up.  This is because on certain maps this will allow you to quickly grab a bunch of cities before the computer can do anything about it and allow you to build a massive advantage in funds.  It also doesn't help that this additional movement can really mess up the computer's preferences in unit selection on certain maps since it's setup to prioritize the purchase of ranged units like launchers over units that can more effectively deal with these fast moving infantry units.",1,1721077135,2526,97,17

Perhaps most importantly, have you ever played a turn based RPG and after a turn immediately thought ""I bet I could have done that so much better""? If you answered even remotely positively to any of these questions, this game may be for you. Do not be fooled, though this game has RPG elements (heavier than most other games in this Tower of the Sorcerer genre), first and foremost it is more akin to a giant puzzle box. The primary difficulty, and subsequently fun, of this particular genre is that you are presented with myriad choices, and your job is to find a solution that not only works to get you through a map, but does it in the best way you can find. Do you attack a powerful enemy first to grab some powerups to make other fights easier? Do you use keys to unlock buffs early or do you save them for later? No matter what you choose, you can always choose to rewind to a few turns earlier, or up to 100 decisions earlier to try something different. The decisions are sometimes overwhelming, but always satisfying to discover a path you feel is the most advantageous. As I mentioned briefly earlier, there are even meta game elements akin to something like Undertale; the best example of this so far being the end of chapter 1 boss, which seriously exceeded my expectations and had a blast playing through and figuring out. If you are still on the fence, try the demo, which as far as I know is the entire 1st chapter, which, on EASY, took me at least 13 hours to play through the first time.

4908,1477330,"tl;dr: I actually got depressed that this game was only sold for < $3 and looked for ways to pay the author more money. Play if you want a very cerebral turn-based puzzle game full of heart, intricate design, and cleverness and don't mind generic graphics.

Soulestination is a deep game in the ""Tower of the Sorceror"" / ""Mota"" genre, a puzzle/RPG hybrid genre which remains popular in China but lesser-known elsewhere, which deconstructs an RPG with finite resources as a sequence of battles and item gathering with deterministic consequences. Mechanically, this is similar in spirit with Desktop Dungeon or the strategic layer of Dream Quest -- you frequently make choices such as whether to spend a (totally non-random) amount of life killing a hard monster so you can get its (totally non-random) loot, or take the safer route of fighting an easier monster instead. The choices get more interesting as the game opens up, with additional abilities and multiple viable builds unlocking a feast of decision-making. There's some meta in the mota, with traces of (slight spoiler) [spoiler] Pony Island, Thimblewood Park, the Matrix, or even Steins;Gate. [/spoiler]

My experience:
1) At first, Soulestination was humble: RPGMaker-looking graphics and amateur English translation didn't show me that much, though by the end of the tutorial dungeon I suspected it would hide a heartful, thoughtful, and often very clever game. 
2) By the boss of Act I, I knew I would have to finish it.
3) By the boss of Act II, I knew I would not be able to finish it because I was too dumb to beat the boss and I was defeated.
3, revisited)... But, as the game has done several times by now, I realized that hidden under the despair was that one spark of hope, and I found a sequence of moves the barely squeaked out a win. It is incredible that a game can consistently do this and (I assume) compensate for many different player builds. 
4) By the end of the game, I knew the game worked because the author put his Soul into the game.",1,1667375011,4607,0,3
4909,1477330,"Awesome ""Magic Tower"" that feels quite unique.
Beside the usual strategic elements of managing ressources (finite amount of health and keys) and stat collection through orbs, the so called soul mechanic largely changes every fight. After a certain amount of fights, you get a major stat boost to take out a single big guy (or 2-3 with good positioning) just to be set back into a weaker state.
Mindlessly killing every low cost enemy likely causes you trouble sooner or later.

That said the game is overall very forgiving on normal mode giving you far more ressources than you really need.

There are a  large variety of active and passive skills for both your own character and enemies. Do you like to have some extra health and Soul out of nowhere? You want a life steal/regen build? Or rather blast the entire room with a boosted spell to weaken/kill enemies before engaging them? Or..
Plenty of ways to play this game and build your character. All could eventually succeed.

Bosses are non generic. Every single one has a certain gimmick / puzzle element and they feel quite unique. Some may require you to move in a specific way, kill no additional enemies or the boss gets boosted, kill everything while not blocking your way or even think a bit ""out of the box"" (literally) to get a proper solution.

All in all a great experience. Not convinced? Try the demo which consists of the entire 1st chapter for a playtime of probably 5-10h depending on how quick you are to make decisions.
10 hours playtime is in my opinion large underestimating the length of this game. You'd need be a true master of this genre and/or be on your 2nd playthrough to beat it this quick.

4910,1477330,"I don't normally review games, but this one is unique and interesting enough that it deserves some words said, particularly given how obscure it is.

For one thing, it's a very unique genre, at least for Western audiences. I've never played a game like this before, or if I have it was back in the old days of online flash games, and even then it was rare enough that I've forgotten all but a glimmer of a feeling.

That feeling is one of, essentially, playing a puzzle game that extends for thousands of continuous steps, each represented simply by what monster you fight next. Your stats and equipment represent decisions that you believe will maximize your health so that when you get to harder decisions, you can make more ""mistakes' along the way. It's very nersnipey for anyone who likes watching numbers go up and figuring out the most efficient and optimal plays.

(Maybe too nerdsnipey: more on that later)

The story is also fairly unique. The translation to English is spotty at times, but I enjoyed the meta narrative of the game, and it does an excellent job of making you think outside the box (or game window) to do better against the bosses. The lateral thinking required for some of these puzzles was very enjoyable to test my brain against, and the ludonarrative harmony between the game mechanics, meta-mechanics, and narrative was really well done.

As a bonus, the music for the game is fantastic, though there are a few bad tracks, notably the first one. I turned the music off after the first map because it was so annoying, but I'm glad I turned it back on to give it a second chance after, because most maps in the game have really good tracks that I'm going to continue to listen to for a while.

As for downsides... the translation issue is one of them. It's not terrible, but there are points where it leads to genuine misunderstandnigs, which can make some of the puzzles more confusing than hard. There's one in the game I had to look online and ask the creator for help on because I just didn't understand what the game was referring to at a certain point. Thankfully the creator is very responsive, and it only delayed my playing for a day.

The nerdsnipey element I mentioned can also be a bit of a downside. Because the game unfolds over thousands of decisions, it can be hard to know how fine-tuned the balancing is. Early bad decisions can lead to you getting stuck, which requires some backtracking... which thankfully the game makes easy, especially if you save often. But this can create paranoia, making you eke out every bit of health from every monster fight even if it takes an extra 10 minutes to get through each map, and this is definitely overkill... or at least, it was for me. It's a hard problem to solve, balance wise, but I think my recommendation would be for each Act to reset your health, not just your Soul, so that after the first one the player knows that they don't need to worry too much about fighting for every scrap of advantage since it won't stay anyway. But that would require a lot of rebalancing, probably, and as-is the game works perfectly fine, particularly for people who are less min-maxy.

Overall a fantastic game that I'm very glad I played, and I hope more people get to experience it. It's crazy how cheap this game is considering how well made it is, and I hope the creator makes more games soon.",1,1701715596,4314,0,5

hard mode is very difficult. It forces you to get good to advance. but it's still very doable. A puzzle with a thousand possible moves. a good challenge. 

It's very much more of a puzzle game than an RPG, but it's still like an RPG in that any advantage you earn you keep

Also the undo button is great. You can go back about 30 fights. Great for testing a course of action


First I played on hard mode. It was pretty great for a while, but midway through the second zone it started to get really slow, because I was struggling to find ways to proceed without dying. I thought ""well, it was fun while it lasted. I definitely got my money's worth out of it already."" and was about to just be done with it. But then I thought I'd try normal mode instead. Started over on normal, and it definitely went a lot faster. But it turned out to be *too* easy after having played hard. I had literally 10x as much health saved up by the time I got to where I stopped on hard mode. No risk at all. But! the second run gave me some ideas. So I started over again on hard, and this time did better. made better use of my resources, and was able to save up a little more. and it paid off. Was enough to let me keep going.


anyway the gameplay is great if you're into puzzles. As for the rest:

the story... is nothing great but is actually more decent than I expected (note I haven't finished the game yet)
the translation is subpar. but it's consistently intelligible. It's all easy to understand.
the music is ok to good, but with only one track per zone, it can get repetitive when I have to take my time considering what moves to make. I have to mute it sometimes.
the UI has a few minor issues, but it's got enough options that I'm satisfied with it


Update:

Now that I have completed the game, I'll say the story is pretty good! Solid. Above average

The gameplay gets even better mid game, when your options really start to open up. Equipment builds and other choices and features add extra layers of strategy onto the puzzling. 

And to clarify on the music: The music itself is good. The issue I noted above is that each zone, which consists of 6-10+ maps, has only the one track, and it's usually relatively short (each zone has its own track though). Also it's mostly just the first zone's track that gets old particularly quickly. The others aren't as bad about it. except the graveyard, since that one's only 1 min long.
But the boss fights (which by the way are great. all unique and mostly all interesting) each have a unique music track. Which is cool. Adds to the uniqueness and makes it more of a climactic moment.

Anyway, I digress. The game is excellent. More than good enough to be worth playing if you like puzzly gameplay.

My first complaint is that this game is only offered in a very small window and there is no option to expand the window size.

My second complaint is that there is no volume settings and the music is extremely annoying forcing me to turn down my speakers all the way down.  Ugh.

My third complaint is that the game forces you to read or skip through ten minutes of dialogue every time you play, even if you choose that you don't need any help at the beginning.

My fourth complaint is there the battles have ZERO influence by you and are simply RNG based, luck detemines the winner once you move your character over an enemy.

My fifth complaint is that there is no procedural generation of the level layouts and every game seems to have the exact same mob layout.  So where there should be strategy in the battles, it's all RNG based (see my 4th complaint above) and where there ""should"" be RNG in level layout, there is none.  This is ""bass ackwards"" of what it should be in my opinion.

My sixth complaint is that you cannot escape or run from a batter in which you are losing or getting stomped.  This means death and ""game over"" forcing you to start over again and once again click thru ten minutes of unskippable dialogue (see my complaint #3 above)

Overall this game just isn't very fun at all and combined with no sound or graphics options, this is a game to avoid regardless of the price.  I wouldn't recommend it even if it were free from my initial experience with it.

4928,1477330,"I picked this game up because I started to take interest in Magic Tower genre recently, and after playing another game of the same genre on Steam for over a hundred hours.

[h1] A little compliment [/h1]

This game takes the base of Magic Tower game, which has simple combat mechanism that involves two sides taking turn to attack and the battle ends when one side runs out of HP. In addition, the game has fixed maps and no random elements. Soulestination further adds interesting aspects to the game, which is the Soul system that gives additional stats on collecting and resets when it is full and you will deal damage to anything you pass by at that moment, which is a double-edged sword. Furthermore, there are items that give positive and negative effects that may change how you will approach a monster or boss fight.

Talking about boss fights, what I did not expect was that every boss fight is a puzzle of its own, and it encourages you to find the best solution so you will be able to defeat the boss with at least amount of damage taken as possible. So far I have only come across 5 bosses, all of which made me feel that I could have done much better by undoing some actions. Yes, you are allowed to undo your actions, and have [b]582 slots of save state[/b] that let you come back at any point you have saved. This is a puzzle game with a generous amount of save states.

[h1] Small complaints [/h1]

However, one thing that continuously became a problem during one boss fight (cursed pots) is that [u] the control doesn't have enough delay in-between.[/u] Overshooting a movement control may end up taking you very far away from a desirable result, and any held down command in this game has this same problem, [b] even the undo control [/b]. I hope this problem is fixed in the near future, as undoing during a boss fight is very time-consuming and tiring. (Therefore it is recommended that you save right before the boss zone entrance).

That concludes my review of my first 5 hours of playing the game. I hope to be able to discover more new things in the future and may update this review.

Oh did I mention that the game is very good cost-value-wise?

[h1]Revision: 60 hours in and chapter 3 [/h1]

60 hours in and I'm at chapter 3 on Normal now. Poor planning of equipment has led me to redo the whole thing from chapter 2 on an old fortunate save. This might be probably the casual filter, but constantly saving the game helped me save a lot of time and build a better head start. I don't even dare to imagine how much micro-optimization the game makes you do on Hard, but each chapter is self-contained with the exception of HP, keys and equipment you bring over, so every single key and crystal and HP spent matters.

Along the way, the game continuously introduces new mechanism for you to work with and a wide variety of boss puzzles to give you a nice headache. My favorite so far is Abyssgazer.

Also the music is banger. I don't know if it's stock, original or commissioned, but I really like it.",1,1629657828,6271,0,13

Of course we need to consider that since the AmaSwag Library has been banned off steam, this game and it's developer have very high requests that they needed to fulfill. Unlike AmaSwag and his Hentai Nazi Game Series, this game takes place in World War 3: Tiddies but in 3D. As a lone warrior defending your family and loved ones, you charge right into battle and take down the cyborg soldiers sent out by the enemy army. They clearly don't have the balls to appear on the battlefield themselves since they use robots for that. The biggest difference between the AmaSwag Games and this one is the Pros. While both games fail to bring up a single negative point to the game, they have different points in which they defy gaming as a whole. While games like Hentai Nazi had their biggest pros in the gameplay, this one outstands in the mapdesign. However, I would have liked it if I was able to turn the camera so I can look at Cyber Waifu from the front and get to look at front side of the character. The absence of a nude DLC is also rather bothering, but it is not a con since I consider that to only be a cosmetic change. Now, since I compared this game to the Hentai Nazi series an awful lot, I just want to say that this game is one of the only ones that is even comparable to that series. No other game on the Steam store has reached such a level of quality to be comparable to that series, so this game has done what was thought impossible and I congratulate the developer for achieving this. I am 100% sure that your game will only get better from this point forward and wish you good luck in your future works.

A runner where the jump height seems rng, the grappling either insta kills you, throws you backwards into your death, doesn't work and there is no feeling of speed/distance to it, so the slow chance you actually can grapple it properly you properly undershoot or overshoot.

I alt+f4 after 6 levels. I wasted like 5 minutes trying to use the grappling mechanic to my benefit but I ended up like 99% of the time dying instantly or enjoying my fall into the void after the button press was ignored.

This game's imagery is a pure manifestation of childhood: how you walked past shelves in a bookstore, examining covers in the fantasy corner, how you read the half-forgotten fairy tales, how you watched countless cartoons, none titles of which you could remember today. The way it evokes nostalgia is not by depicting how you lived, but rather how you was thinking, dreaming and fantasizing about great kingdoms and obscure adventures, which is pretty universal. That is the greatest achievement of solo dev Ozzie Sneddon, and I can recommend this game for anyone to feel this way alone. 

Essentially, it doesn't matter if gameplay-wise this game doesn't offer much, although it tries to tweak some things with little mechanics here and there, if it's too short, if the music is sometimes irritating, and if lore bits are ciphered from stupid people like me (thanks for the tip Ozzie, tho)  — all these things are negated by what it leaves afterwards, that is, reemerged feeling of childish joy and excitement.

People have written entire novels on the meaning of life, death, sorrow, peace, etc., but these characters say just as much with only a few poignant lines of dialogue.

This game isn't so much a ""game"" as it is a narrative experience though. Stages branch off into other stages, requiring a bit of backtracking in order to complete all the routes. This can be a little tedious at times, but is the only downside to this otherwise fascinating world.

The characters are vibrant and so very human, despite looking otherwise at first glance. The settings are surreal and gorgeous. The music is... odd sometimes, but ultimately sets the mood quite well.

Overall, this short game is both charming and humbling. Thank you Ozzie for putting so much passion into this piece; when times get tough, I'll probably think of this experience now and then.",1,1627760974,281,0,6
5003,1476800,"[h1] To all the people reading this, I recommend you finish the full game, explore every location in the game perceiving its beauty whilst doing so, this game is an astounding experience and exploring every region enables you to proceed even further in the lore of the game in which regard I choose not to specify so as to encourage others into experiencing a blind play-through and as to not ruin the lore. [/h1]

[b] tl;dr [/b] - Quit wasting your time looking at reviews and get the bloody game already, its an absolute masterpiece.

The game is an absolute masterpiece, having each area, each character hand drawn, every area resonates its own ambience, being different in its own way, every area is beautiful and very cleverly made by [b] Ozzie Sneddon [/b], each character is unique and is characterized by the developer in such a way, you wished they were real, you wished you knew them, you wish you could spend reality with them and each character, hand-crafted by [b] Ozzie Sneddon [/b] is beautiful, from the ones with the tiniest of dialogues stretching all the way to the ones that play a major part in the lore of the game.

The game also features its own unique play style, wherein as you explore areas as an artisan, seeking inspiration about what life and death truly is, these areas furthermore branch out into plethora's of areas, each one more glamorous than the last, every  region expresses its individuality from the others, being greatly unique from other areas since you cannot (always) proceed into further areas.

The soundtrack of the game is a masterpiece, every areas soundtrack gets better as you spend more time in the area and proceeds only to get better each time you revisit the area, being the reason I have over 15 hours in this game, I liked to spend my time in each area, re-experiencing it over and over while proceeding to another. The game is also a source of inspiration, while the plot revolves around inspiration itself! A lot can be learned about how one perceives the world, and their view on life and death can from this game.

[b] Ozzie Sneddon[/b], being a solo dev who worked on this game has created perfection, you sir have created a world that people will never forget, a world that will forever reside in peoples hearts. Thank you for developing one of the most wonderful experiences.

This game is the type where you wish you could forget all of it, and play it blind, all from the beginning.

~ DIFFICULTY ~

✅ My 90 year old grandma could play it
🔲 Easy
🔲 Normal 
🔲 Hard
🔲 Dark Souls

Not really a difficulty based game, it is more focused on lore hence being unique and beautiful. 

~ GRAPHICS ~

🔲 MS Paint
🔲 Bad
🔲 Meh
🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game
🔲 Good
🔲Beautiful
✅ Masterpiece

Each character and area is hand-drawn exquisitely, looks fabulous.

~ MUSIC ~

🔲 Bad
🔲 Not special
🔲 Good
✅ Beautiful

You would keep returning to areas just for the music and the lore, it is splendid. Keeps getting better every single time.

~ STORY ~

🔲 This game has no story
🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story
🔲 It's there for the people who want it
🔲 Well written
🔲 Epic story
✅ Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack

The lore is beautiful, starts off with a simple story of an artisan seeking inspiration for his magnum opus, a tower representing the meaning of life and death, and delves deeper and deeper and ends with a banger (after having experienced every area in the game)

~ PRICE ~

🔲 Free
🔲 Underpriced
✅ Perfect Price
🔲 Could be cheaper
🔲 Overpriced 
🔲 Complete waste of money

Prices are set regionally by the developer and are affordable, one can say it is under-priced not for the length gameplay it offers which is average, but for the lore, the soundtrack, the visuals and the experience.

~ REQUIREMENTS ~

🔲 You can run it on a microwave 
✅ Average
🔲 High end
🔲 NASA computer

Requirements are stated on the store page and aren't high at all, easily can be run on a low end laptop.

~ LENGTH ~

🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours)
✅Short (2 - 15 hours) 
🔲 Average (15-50 hours)
🔲 Long (50-100 hours)
🔲 Extremely long (100+ hours)
🔲 No ending (cuz multiplayer)

Depending person to person the game lasts, I spent my time repeating areas because the game was so beautiful in prospect of the soundtrack, visuals, the lore and the will to complete it to a 100% because of its magnificence. Hence enabling me to have over 15 hours in the game

~ FUN ~

🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry
🔲 Hard to enjoy
🔲 Repetitive
🔲 Actually pretty amusing
✅The kind of fun you'll remember
🔲 Ride of your life

The gameplay is good, your job is to traverse and explore areas, interact with the characters to expand yourself into the lore achieve different 'endings', find secrets, make decisions. Very fun overall

~ REPLAYABILITY~

🔲 It's a one-time experience
🔲 Only for achievements
✅ If you wait a few months/years
🔲 Definitely
🔲 Infinitely replayable

Each area can be reexperienced repetedly since the lore is splendid and likely hard to forget because of its beauty, not in just the lore, but in the soundtracks and each hand-drawn area as well, but you are likely not to forget such a game without not playing it for a while. You would wish you could forget it and play it all over again.",1,1627066218,1178,0,5

5005,1476800,"After having played Existensis repeatedly, I must say that it’s truly an amazing game: the colorful world, fantastically illustrated, wonderful music, backstory unveiling simple truths about the meaning of life that we all instinctively know, all this keeps drawing me back to the game and I can’t get enough of it. Game uses platformer concept, divided into branching levels representing diverse corners of the world of Eré, through which you guide the hero, an artist and designer seeking inspiration for his new tower construction, to unlock their secrets and progress further. Gameplay is smooth and of middle length; you need to replay some levels several times to gain access to all the following stages, but the levels are relatively short so it doesn’t get frustrating (I liked that every level had something unique in them, a mechanic or element not seen in others). Playing this was an artistic experience for me, and if you have similar inclination don’t hesitate to try it – and may it spark an inspiration in you as well.",1,1671364061,868,0,185
5006,1476800,"I would recommend this game if for no other reason than that it's the kind of game I want to see more of in the world: stylish, imaginative, and created with the kind of singular vision that only small, independent creators are really free to indulge in.

Of course, a game can be all those things and still suck, so it helps a lot that Existensis is truly an engaging little gem. It tells the story of The Mayor, a wandering (and leaping!) artist seeking inspiration for his masterwork across a variety of gorgeous, hand-drawn environments. The fantasy setting is original, richly detailed without getting bogged down in lore, and full of curious and intriguing characters - I was reminded of Evan Dahm's ""Rice Boy"" in particular, and stylistic comparisons to Fantastic Planet or The Dark Crystal could also be made. Each area has its own unique character while clearly being tied to the same world as the others, and there are some really nice setpieces like a city made of ambulatory buildings that assembles itself around you as you explore, or a dreary, hallucinatory underworld realm designed to confuse and misdirect you at every turn.

The writing overall is very good, even profound at times. It asks questions about life, creativity, what it is that makes good art, and what makes art, or life, worthwhile, and it provides multiple answers - many compelling, but none decisive. It's not only a well-told story, but one that meshes especially well with an idiosyncratic, one-person project like this one. 

On the mechanical level the game runs and plays well - movement is wonderfully fluid, and while the levels are relatively small, there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. I was worried that the hand-drawn style might make it difficult to figure out which platforms were reachable and which were just background, but this was seldom if ever a problem. There are one or two somewhat weird control/design choices. In particular, because the game rarely prompts for confirmation, sometimes I found myself inadvertently travelling to another region by accident or getting teleported back to the start of the game because I talked to the wrong person, or hit ""S"" at the wrong time. The ability to travel to already-visited regions at any time (instead of after completing the one you're currently on) would have done a lot to help there, but overall I'd consider this a minor annoyance at worst. Controller support would have been nice, too, maybe we'll get that in some future version? And I'm happy to report I experienced absolutely zero performance or stability issues.

There is not a lot of challenge here, gameplay-wise, nor is there meant to be. This game is about exploring a world and the ideas it represents, and drinking in the sights and sounds you find there. Expect to take anywhere from 3-5 hours to play through the whole thing, assuming you're playing at a reasonably leisurely pace... I imagine a speedrunner could get through the whole thing in no more than half an hour, but that would, of course, be almost entirely missing the point. 

The game's currently $9 USD on sale, and if you've been curious about it, I would not hesitate to pick it up at that price. Even at full fare ($15 as of this writing), if this is the sort of game that interests you, do yourself and the rest of us a solid and pick up a copy. You'l be glad you did.",1,1637966548,226,0,16
5007,1476800,"Existensis is a delight and an absolute masterpiece. It's one of the most beautiful games I've played, and I found its unusual method of storytelling entirely captivating.

I have fallen in love with this world and will eagerly follow Ozzie Sneddon's work to learn more (I see he's already made one other game, The Mull Littoral https://www.librariumstudios.com ). 

A few minor concerns: I wish that the wonderfully animated journal indicated one additional piece of information, namely, the name of the current location. It can become easy to forget when there are (blissfully) so many. Also, the Thoughtform for Truth also wouldn't activate unless I pointed the Artist to the left, which was the only technical glitch I encountered.

5012,1476800,"Beautiful and peaceful.  The story is intriguing, the characters have interesting dialogues.  Many of them are playful or even flirty.  ONce you have been through an area you can always access that area again after the end of a play-through, which takes only 15-20 minutes.  The only thing I found a bit cryptic was the level selection screen that appears after you complete a play-through.  The labeling for how to navigate is very small near the bottom and if you press any button other than D you are immediately sent to the level your marker is on, with no confirmation screen.  It took me a few times to realize what was actually going on and that I could go to any level, if I just pressed D to navigate without pressing anything else.  

This is pretty impressive for being made entirely by one person!  Music art and level design are all excellent.  The gameplay itself is fairly simple, with some minor platforming puzzles, no damage or game overs.  The search for meaning and inspiration is rewarding, with each ending giving you a different work of architecture as the end result of your journey.

No achievements at this time. Took me 4-5 hours to play through but the time was very enjoyable so definitely felt is was worth it.  A nice chill game when you want some exploration and movement but no fighting or strife.  Thanks Ozzie!",1,1634274758,305,0,252

This game is immersive, allowing access to a world thoughtfully built through history, mythos, and art. Exploring this world provides an opportunity to introspect into our own thoughts -- its as if, just like our character, we're constructing something to model our own experience of life and death. So many different opinions are presented in this game, but how we synthesize them into a meaningfully whole is up to us. Does the Witch of Wrath present a view of life contradictory to the Thoughtform of Kindness? Haha, this game is so beautiful in the way it encourages us to ask questions like this -- and all while listening to a well-suited soundtrack, that varies with each province. A touch that I like is how often the characters call one another friends. It's heart-warming, just such a nice game. 

If you do pick it up, I'd recommend playing with a lit candle nearby and some tea :)",1,1627107230,269,0,48
5014,1476800,"Here is a link to the [url=https://youtu.be/g4VnV4ONTBg]video review[/url] if you prefer to listen.
In order to keep spoilers to a minimum, this is going to be a super short review.
Existensis is a platforming exploration game that follows a colorful man named ‘The Mayor’ on his search for the meaning of life and death for his magnum opus, a tower that symbolizes what it means to be alive. This journey takes the Mayor down many roads, multiple times in fact; and at almost every setting he will meet other people also traveling but for their own reasons. In one timeline he will travel with one and other timelines another, leading to diverging paths. At the end of every path there is some inspiration but his opus will not be completed until every path available is traveled to its fullest.
The world made by Mr. Sneddon is packed with lore and world building that I was not expecting. I only got a glimpse of it through playing this game and I am already hoping for another project of some kind that continues the tales of some of these characters and places. The imaginative writing is matched with the equally imaginative art style and character design. Different kinds of city and landscapes with vibrant colors solidify this fantasy into something real. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to jump around its many levels all the while listening to a surprisingly well made soundtrack. The compositions for each area fit perfectly and further elevated this memorable experience. I also loved seeing the artifacts of the animation process carry into the final product. This organic treatment of animation style really made everything feel alive. For a solo dev project that was literally made by hand, I cannot find fault in the writing, visuals, or soundtrack. But there is more to this game than these things. I mean it IS a game after all. So how does it play?
The gameplay is exceedingly simple; you can move left, right, jump, and interact with the people and world around you. The platforming is a tad muddy and the more modern platforming style of being able to drop through a platform is not included here. Sometimes the platforms were hard to differentiate, but never to the point of frustration and I have a feeling some of it was intentional. The game is short (I completed it in less than four hours) and most of the game is redoing areas to travel down new paths. Because of how short the areas were, it avoided becoming tedious and reaching the final ending was rewarding. 
This is definitely an exploration platformer, but I would say Existensis is an experience more than a videogame. The thoughts on life and death might not be new to people that have taken philosophy classes (or just thought a lot about it) but the way it is presented was thoughtful and the execution pleased my brain, eyes, and ears. I am giving Existensis a 4 out of 5 meaning, please go and buy this game if you like good fantasy writing and art or if you like the artistic side of indie games in general. It was worth the money spent and I would spend more for the soundtrack, Ozzie. OK I said enough.",1,1627083420,227,0,36

This game is also perfect for people like myself who just want some type of casual interactive entertainment to distract themselves, without too much intense or complicated gameplay.

The only thing that should be improved is navigation. It's not clear which areas are which, and triggering the ending can be unclear. Despite the multiple endings, the way to get each of them is pretty much the same (you either collect more or less inspiration and trigger the ending at a certain location) and it might seem a little sloggish to get all 13 when the journey is the same.

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/ummorpg-51212

The fact that this developer uses this asset kit doesn't concern me because it looks as if he's made his own story, his own quests, his own maps and dungeons himself, and that's great!

Here's my first impressions livestream playing this game:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJE1FcyhMk4

As you'll see in my stream, this game is simple, and fine but the fact the the in game FPS tanks every ten to fifteen seconds is a big concern.  I can stand in place and do nothing and still watch the FPS drop from 60 to 23 every few seconds.  While in combat or while running, these fps drops are very much felt.   I have a brand new gaming MSI Trident 3 with an i7 10700 # 3.4 Ghz, and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super with 8 GB DDR5, and 16 GB of Dual Channel DDR4 RAM.  Graphics like this should not be bringing my computer to its knees!

I did reboot my PC, didn't even launch OBS so wasn't streaming, and tried the game again only to see that it made NO difference at all.  I was still dropping to 23 fps every ten to fifteen seconds just standing still.

I'll give this game a 6 out of 10 based on what i see, and I'll recommend this game because I don't want to not recommend what I believe this developer has probably put a LOT of work and effort into.. but I can't genuinely recommend this game until this fps issue is resolved.

I wish I could leave a review and choose N/A on the recommendation for now.  Be advised that this game might have serious fps drops on computers that aren't as new as my gaming pc.",1,1614261675,107,0,1273

[b]football girl[/b] is a puzzle game where you must guide a ball by drawing-in the level.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Guide a soccer ball to a goal. You are able to draw obstacles and ramps using a ""magic pencil"". Your ink is unlimited, so don't be afraid to get creative! The levels aren't always able to be completed with a single stroke; sometimes it is necessary whip-up a [i]impromptu roller coaster[/i] or several platforms to guide the ball. Before starting a new game, you may customize your waifu. After beating the game, you can talk her -- she asks for an obscene amount of money, but it just keeps going higher.

In other words, it appears to be that [b]football girl[/b] cannot be beat!

I think you're trying-out for a soccer school and trying to get into a cute girl's pants. . .[i] I think?[/i]

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen looks [i]okay,[/i] but it's unclear what each icon does. You can adjust audio and language preferences from the gearbox icon. The ""play"" and ""upload"" icons are used for playing the game; the upload icon seems to change in usage after beating the game. The dialogue is slow and painful, and often cut-off. The game will sometimes fade to new scenes before dialogue has a chance to finish rendering.

I am unsure if this game is supposed to have adult content or not. This [b]looks[/b] like a game with sexual content, but I didn't see anything (and the developers have not provided a patch.)

I don't recommend this game -- wait for updates. I couldn't be bothered to complete this game. [b]football girl[/b] is terrible. The gameplay is unrefined, and dialogue is clearly broken.

5035,1475960,"TL;DR: A game about throwing a party, that made me feel delighted and happy as I got to know its characters, and melted my cold and cynical heart.


I did not expect to love this gem of a game and I do, I absolutely love it. It's rare that I play a game and the only negative that I can think of is that it doesn't (yet) have a sequel that I can go and play straight after this one. I'm listening to its soundtrack right now while I'm writing this, and appreciating the many little touches of warmth and genius that I found in every scene and location, every dialogue and interaction (and reaction) of the characters, every thoughtful lunge. Finely-crafted dialogue getting strong and lovable characterisations across to the player with voice-acting that nailed the right tone every time (I paid attention throughout the whole game - Don't ask what's in it!) and a game full of designed details that just made me smile and enjoy.

The developers of this game pitched it as an uplifting experience and it delivered - some truly lovely smiles and chuckles to be had from this game, even for a zesty rulebreaker hoomin like me. I think what clinches it for the player is the excellent characterisations and voice acting that made this a real pleasure to play and experience. Even when I wondered what would happen if I turned on the radio in my hut, the devs had taken care of that, and I was treated to an ensemble of wonderful fun adverts and jingles and philosophy which was a gift that kept on giving for a delightfully immersive time.

And I think that was the key to my falling in love with this game - the many details and surprises which made all sorts of things worth clicking on and which made all of the interactions with characters a real treat - this has so obviously been crafted by devs who care about their game and who care about giving players some really satisfying experiences and feelings. I really enjoyed discovering each scene and interacting with all of the game elements. 

I relived some of the best bits of my game-playing youth while playing this game, because in its own unique way, Shindig is a finely-nuanced homage to a golden era of Sam 'n Max and Monkey Island with a dash of extra retro charm and fun. It does all that and with its own identity too. Am cat!

After playing Shindig for a few hours, I went and checked out the devs' website and realised that all of the just-right touches and details throughout the game, and all the self-assured musical ambiance, carefully-crafted dialogue etc. was no accident - these devs have honed their craft over decades of working at the heart of the biggest game development houses on the planet and it really shows - they have absorbed kawaii cuteness and game design chops into their DNA and it's all on display here in their first game. I'm excited to see what they create next. And I could so watch a TV series based on these characters and this game world.

A surprise hit for me - and at a price where I think anyone can give it a go and discover for themselves - and hopefully the first of many from this developer. Well done Imaginary Friends Games for coming up with my Feelgood Game Of The Year. Beautiful. Mogick.",1,1631128786,281,0,4
5036,1475960,"If this game doesn't put a smile on your face, I honestly don't know what will.

Shindig plays like a traditional point 'n' click - you talk to folk, pick up objects, and even access your inventory by moving your mouse cursor to the top of the screen, à la classic adventure games such as Broken Sword. The story is pretty straightforward - you answer a job advertisement to travel to a small island and help organise a party. But the real strength of this game is in its characters. The island is home to a wide variety of folk, and each one is absolutely bursting with personality and individuality. Honestly, most of the characters in this game are far more memorable than those you'd find in most AAA titles these days. They're all brought to life by wonderful art and utterly charming voice acting.

I played through the bulk of the game in one sitting, and even went out of my way to hunt down all of the achievements, something I rarely do. It's not a long game - you can easily finish it in one or two sittings, but every second of it has so much heart and soul in it.

Also - gotta mention the music - it's fantastic, and there's a surprising amount of it!

I can't wait to see more stuff from these devs (plus I need to know what's behind that waterfall!)",1,1631228286,189,0,30
5037,1475960,"Shindig is a lot more than its simple premise and visuals belie. 

Tasked with setting up a party after accepting a job offer and travelling to an island the game plays out as a fairly linear point and click adventure that has a run time of a few hours, but it is the characters, the positive social messages, the slightly surreal setting, and the easy going humour of the writing that elevates it above all of anybody's initial impressions.

A joy to play, and a game that deserves better than most will give it credit for <3",1,1631311734,314,0,7
5038,1475960,"[h1]PBS vibes[/h1]

Relentlessly positive and meticulously inclusive, Shindig is a ~3 hour point + click adventure by Imaginary Friends games, a small studio consisting of married couple Martyn Maillardet and Fay Maillardet.   While both Fay and Martyn have extensive backgrounds in the game industry at large companies like Sony and Nintendo, this is their first independent release.  The game is struggling to find its audience a little, so I picked it up to support quality work and to see for myself what it's all about.

In Shindig, your customizable player character is taken to an idyllic little island by a talking boat to assist in planning a party.  The game's main goal is to run around the island collecting party necessities and associated festivity accouterments such as cake, sweet tunes, and cool decorations.  To accomplish this, you must befriend the game's ~15 characters spread out across a dozen locations or so, mostly through the completion of fetch quests, scavenger hunts, and a few pretty simple adventure-style puzzles.

As it turns out, Shindig feels a bit like a cross between Mutazione (go buy it if you haven't heard of it) and Peppa Pig - While appropriate for all audiences, it's not a game made FOR kids per se, as it doesn't pull any punches with its vocabulary and touches on some threads that may resonate more with an adult audience (maintaining a positive work/life balance, making healthy career choices, etc), but it definitely has a bit of a children's cartoon vibe.

Shindig is fully voiced.  The voice work isn't bad, which is especially impressive as virtually all characters are voiced by Fay Maillardet herself.  With so many characters in the game, some of the voices end similar to each other, but I totally respect the achievement.  

The game runs smoothly; my playthrough had no hiccups or bugs to speak of.

[h1]Inclusivity and Accessibility[/h1]

Like any self-respecting children's cartoons, Shindig is especially forward with its positive and inclusive messaging.  Despite the limited character creation options, I appreciated that you do have the ability to play as a character wearing a turban or a headscarf.  

Accessibility features such as closed captioning are included in the game and are not only on by default, but integrated into the scenes so that they appear dynamically where the sound occurs.  They are also written with an uncommon amount of effort and humor.  Every background song in the game (there are many good ones) gets its own little description, for instance.  As an example, one description might be something like ""upbeat poppy song with an electronic beat, very adventurous feeling"" and then you go inside and the description will say ""same theme as outside, but no beat and reorchestrated to be a lot more chill"".  I really appreciated this feature, which goes above and beyond standard captioning.

[b] Important note, in my build of the game, the game's music was off by default.  I strongly recommend checking the settings and bumping up the music slider to 50% or so before starting the game, just in case this is not patched. [/b]

Incidentally, all of the game's characters are extremely respectful of one another, even when they disagree.  While the game's dialogue is largely light, humorous, and inoffensive, it can occasionally touch on more personal matters, and these issues are discussed frankly, honestly, and correctly.

As the main story progresses, you will unlock optional scenes which can be viewed through a portrait gallery in your character's house.  These scenes tend to be a bit more personal than the scenes in the main game, and they feel a little autobiographical.  These can be skipped, but I recommend playing them.

[h1]In Conclusion[/h1] 

I'm not really sure who exactly this game is for, but I liked it.  You might like it too.",1,1632790670,177,0,220
5039,1475960,"Not a challenge, but a delight. Full of character, humour and heart - more than this jaded old gamer was expecting.

If you like watching familiar childhood films when you need comfort for a couple of hours, this is a good pick for you.",1,1631237614,148,0,37
5040,1475960,"While Shindig may appear to be aimed at children the game can be enjoyed by all, okay maybe not dark souls fans unless you fancy a change of pace. While the game’s puzzles are simplistic unlike other point-and-click games it does not take away from the overall experience Shindig will scratch that point-and-click adventure itch. The perfect experience for point-and-click adventure fans and people that want a relaxing, insightful game with its relatable characters, its running mental health themes and how it’s okay to be a square peg in a circle hole. I have been struggling to get into gaming lately, and Shindig was one I sailed through and found myself laughing out loud and also relating to some of the characters. While the game is short easily completed in 2/3 hours it’s the perfect game to fully immerse yourself in. I would also love to see more from the developers especially what’s behind the waterfall?

5041,1475960,Very nice game with funny and charming characters. With just under 3 hours of playtime perfect for a weekend!,1,1631033298,173,0,1
5042,1475960,"Hey there hoomin!

Tbh, the moment I started creating my character, the game had already got me. Not just because there are many (hair) styles you can choose from, but the developers really made an effort to make variety and diversity one of the integral components of this game. And as you can feel while playing, they were very successful in doing so.

The individual and lovable characters are the main reason for playing this charming game! They come to life through their different personal backgrounds, their relationships between one another and their different ways of speaking (which is evident thanks to the great voice acting). But most of all, these characters are damn funny! Playing this game really made me laugh out loud - a lot. That's why Shindig is not necessarily a single player game. You can also play it together with your family or friends to enjoy the jokes all together. I did the latter and it was one of the most entertaining nights in months. 

Moreover, the tunes are darn catchy. I had to buy the soundtrack after finishing the game. So be warned! 

One last thing: 
English is not my mother tongue (as you may have noticed), but the game is perfectly playable for people with average English knowledge. You may also learn some interesting (British) expressions as well.",1,1631092495,646,0,1

5044,1475960,"Cute game! I love all the little personal touches and I got a few good laughs from some of the dialog.

There's also a great interview with the creators on Robot Republic's YouTube channel. Very kind people.

It  took me four hours to play through and it wasn't difficult. I did get stuck at one point and needed a hug to work out what to do next but other than that just talk to everyone and poke everything and you'll be taken on a charming journey.
If you are looking for a game that is more like an interactive art installation than challenging puzzle game then this is definitely for you.

It's on the easy side, but it's cute and it's silly - the best combination. Though if you go through all the sitdowns with people you'll realize that it still covers quite some grown up things as well.

Also Steve is the best. Pretty sure Steve told me so Steveself.",1,1634398821,142,0,71
5053,1475960,"This is a really wholesome, lovely and funny indie point and click adventure. 

It's a pretty easy game, when it comes to the puzzles (was only stuck once for a short time). Where it shines is the lovely characters, the voice acting and the puns, that create a cozy, quirky and welcoming atmosphere in which exploration always feels nice and rewarding. 

What surprised me the most is how absolutely positive and inviting the game felt, even though it touches on a variety of ""hard"" topics in the dialogues with most of the inhabitants of the island. 

Also, as an added bonus, the developer was super fast to fix a bug, that initially hindered me from progressing further into the game. 

10 / 10, would play again! :D

Also looking forward to more genuinely wholesome games like this. <3

5055,1475960,"I don't think you can play Shindig through without smiling to yourself and feeling comforted by its world and characters. I love playing this game, and I love everybody in this game. I also laughed out loud in several moments (all of Astrid's lines for starters). The music is adorable, the art is bright and expressive, and THE CHARACTERS!

Shindig is a short game, and this makes it even more special. I feel it is easier to build characters and worlds when you have hours to slowly introduce them and show their personalities, but creating a cast of memorable characters when you have limited time takes a lot of skill and talent. I have played around 3 hours and a half, according to Steam, and I already felt more attached to Little Extra and Mousey (of course I love Steve too, but Steve does have a pretty big fanclub already) than to a lot of characters in other, bigger, games/movies/books. I honestly squealed when I went back to the beach hut and saw all the portraits and the short scenes with each of the characters.

You can feel the love and care that has been put into it in EVERYTHING, not only the characters. I am terrible at point and click games, but in this occassion I didn't mind walking up and down the map clicking on everything clickable waiting for my brain to slowly put things together, and, sometimes, sitting down and chilling, enjoying the art and the sounds, because Shindig will let you do that. There is no hurry, no countdowns, just helping around and being helped. Shindig just felt good in a warm, essential way.",1,1632336912,217,0,1
5056,1475960,"This is a lovely little game that I can easily recommend to anyone looking for a chilled out, conflict-free puzzle game.  The game is built on a foundation of wholesome kindness and good vibes, with no edgy threats or crises to avert.  It's just a really nice place to be.

That said, there's still a good amount to do in the game, which even as a point-and-click veteran kept me engaged for several hours.  It wasn't the hardest game I've ever played but that's not a criticism here.  Shindig's main draw (IMO) are its characters, who are all likeable, well-written and well-performed, backed up by a lot of surreal humour that was right up my alley.

Ultimately, this is a game with a huge amount of heart.  If you like its look and style then it's almost certainly what you're hoping it is, and more.  Plus the music is stupidly catchy, so there's that, too.",1,1631380796,211,0,1

5058,1475960,"Gonna have ourselves a Shindig!!!

Bought this charmingly illustrated and voiced old-school Point and Click adventure for my nine year old daughter, but found myself drawn in to the cartoon world of Shindig too, so spent the next few hours playing it with her and we both thoroughly enjoyed the game.

I know she liked this game as she has been singing the catchy tunes ever since!

A really nice concept (who doesn't love having a party?) with friendly and memorable characters. Would recommend for young and old gamers alike who are looking for a relaxing evenings gaming.

Puzzles just tricky enough to keep us going, and once completed, some excellent additional epilogue/character based exposition - looking at you STEVE!!!

Clever use of music and songs tie the whole story together.

I've written far more than I intended to, but thought folks might like a bit more than the ""So Cool, I LOVE STEVE!"" that my nine year old wanted to post.

I love how this game starts off so simple, but then, with every new level, a new element of intensity is introduced. This makes the game quite stressful but also gripping. I really began to care about Bruce and his plants.

The storytelling in this game is absolutely superb. Especially when you look at the simplicity of the game as a whole. There is an intricate storyline with such detail. Something that I did not expect coming into the game. I love the references to our current times, and history. It is obvious that a lot of thought and care has gone into this part of the game.

The look of this game attributes itself to a certain style of gaming. It is very consistent with this and helps me to believe in the story and the world.

5086,1476100,"An intriguing concept, but the execution falls far short. It feels like this was released very prematurely.

- The story is sparse, disjointed, and contrived.
- The graphics are bland.
- The vehicle mechanics are obfuscated but shallow, and completely trivialized by an infodump you stumble across early on that explains how to ignore both power consumption and enemies.
- It's almost impossible to lose; you're given huge amounts of resources even before learning how to bypass any threats. The hardest challenge was finding the lever to pull to win the game, which unlike every other control in the game was hidden in decorative trim for some reason.
- At $20 for ~2 hours of gameplay with no replayability, it's just not a very good deal.",0,1623473510,157,0,11
5087,1476100,"It was a good game, but a bit too short. I hope it receives some updates in the future to add more content, but as it stands it only has 2-3 hours of gameplay. It is definitely worth playing, but you may consider waiting for a sale. I loved every moment of playing this game. It had a good story, and extremely fun controls. The sense of mystery brought by the discreet storytelling, and limited view of the outside world made it very captivating.",1,1623627319,362,0,21
5088,1476100,"It's Nauticrawl, in VR. That game was pretty neat as it was, but the immersion added by VR is basically perfect for it. Not terribly long, but worth the time it asks of you.",1,1623601240,59,0,8

5090,1476100,"I'd probably recommend this game, but don't expect your hand to be held at all during it. It would be cool if there was more story that wasn't hidden in logs and such, but it doesn't really matter if you look at this game as an escape room-esque game. 

My only problems with the game are with the space needed. You definitely need more space than some VR game require. The way around this is to reset your view within SteamVR by pressing the menu button, but it was still annoying. The very last puzzle was also a little annoying, I thought I was doing everything right but nothing was happening, but I guess I didn't have a level pushed *all* the way or something. 

Outside all that though, I'd say this game was a really cool experience. Just wish it was a little longer or maybe had more depth or something since it only takes like 2 hours to beat. I'd say what was there was quality enough to justify only a $20 purchase though",1,1623472156,135,0,14
5091,1476100,"Great game. You can never really see what's going on outside your crawler so a lot of things evolve in your head wich is awesome. The replay value is limited once you're through, especially when you've played nauticrawl beforehand and I hope something will be integrated to get me back to it again. 

Nevertheless, worth every penny.",1,1623779298,156,0,53
5092,1476100,"Quick Gameplay Summary: It's sort of like Myst - if you were in control of a vehicle as you try to uncover the world's secrets and story. But you can die (such as from running out of fuel/power, though the game is generous with supplies and if you still struggle, there's an upgrade you can buy to inherit some things between playthroughs), and there is just a bit of combat (and stealth).

I loved Nauticrawl and I think this is the perfect game to get a VR remake - now all the controls are hands on and it feels great. It also has a few more hints than the original without giving things away (trust me, it can still be a lot of figure out on your own, but there's slightly more intuition to it), and the game doesn't kill you over and over while you try to figure out how to start the engine in the beginning - making it, IMO, quite a bit more newbie friendly. But it is a puzzle game, so prepare for frustration if you're not very patient.

So if you haven't played the original, I actually recommend this one *more*.

If you've played the original - some of the puzzles, controls, are so on have been added to or polished up a bit. Nonetheless, it's essentially the same - you can fly through the game if you have a decent memory of the original. Even so, I love the feeling of being there in (virtual) person and getting hands on with the controls.

Downsides: No control rebinding (Though it's simple enough that this is probably OK). You also can't stick-turn as you can in other modern VR games. When the game occasionally wants to give me a message outside of the game's context, such as how the controls work, it flies by way too fast to read. In fact there's no options at all besides language selection.

Sometimes when loading a game, it resets the crawler to an engine-off power-off state. All your inventory, fuel levels, etc seems to save properly when this happens, but it can be a bit disorienting. If you encounter this bug, just throw the main power switch and then restart the engine.

Visuals... are clearly on a limited budget. Really cool even so, but just a heads up that it's not top end.

And lastly, once you find the final ""mission"" so to speak, you're locked out from exploring the other destinations that you may not have visited yet. Really wish you weren't.

5098,1476100,"While the gameplay is basically unchanged from Nauticrawl, I think the VR environment does add quite a bit to the experience. Nauticrawl suffered a bit from not knowing if it wanted to be a rogue-like or something more like a walking simulator and they've leaned more heavily towards the latter in this version, which I think was a wise decision that plays better with VR's immersive experiential nature.",1,1682731250,107,0,115
5099,1476100,"S.P.O.'s entry into the surprisingly niche genre of fictional sims (think ""In other waters"", ""vtol vr"", ""far: lone sails"", etc.) has like Hopoo Game's seminal classic ""Risk of Rain 2"" survived the transition from 2D to 3D, this time using VR to further draw you into its surprisingly obscure world.

Complaints for this game are brief as most which I positively recommend bear, but do require repeating.

 - Half Life: Alyx, has shown how moving controls should be handled, when someone grasps a lever or other moving object, the game should simply constrain the hand's movement to only the axis of movement the object allows. Here, if you grab and wildly pull a lever, instead of satisfyingly watching it slam home, your hand may slip off when your controller departs the 'rails' too much.

 - There is no in-game movement options available. It is forced room-scale VR, and you must use SteamVR's recenter tool if the game has deigned to place your controls outside the bounds of your playspace. Thankfully, I was able to recenter it in such a way that most of the controls remained comfortably within, but setting that up was difficult. I would like to advise the developers to take a look at Vtol VR, and Derail Valley for advise on how they should handle fixed controls in a playspace.

 - I also simply do not like the elevator puzzle... just take me to the menu please. 

Please do not let the detail into which I have gone dissuade you from this game, the complaints are few and themselves minor once you understand what you're working with. Honestly, smaller games from bigger companies have had more issues.

Nauticrawl is a fantastic rogue-lite, presenting you it's panel-o-buttons, and fields of danger to navigate, alongside very little documentation, but now we have a plausible reason: You're an unskilled laborer, having snuck into a giant behemoth of a machine that moves in perhaps the most obtuse way possible, and yet it somehow is perfect for the task you're endeavoring to do.

The translation to 3D and vr, again, rough at times, deepens the immersion and furthers the confusion. You now do not get switches at every screen to turn on and off your computers, instead they've been helpfully moved to a single control panel just for the switches... and now you have to remember which one is which. Reach over, pull down the periscope press the buttons and have a grand time driving around on what feels like an ocean floor, except there's somehow an atmosphere.

Displays and readouts will confound you, and you will press buttons hoping they go away. Sometimes, the problem manages to solve itself... other times, that is the greater peril. There are sharpe corners to this game, and most of your death screens condense a few minutes of panicked scrambling into paltry sentences, which somehow seem to work their way into the next run. You might intercept transmissions between 2 other crawlers, talking about how they manage batteries, or avoid getting shot, or find the corpse of a some poor bastard who didn't - probably you in another life.

I'd gladly get it again, and I really wish that the game could have lasted longer than it did.",1,1676272766,69,0,19
5100,1476100,"I liked figuring out the machine, but I didn't enjoy manouvering around the world.",0,1655988498,67,0,1421
5101,1476100,"I completed this game very quickly even though I was taking my time. I didn't end up visiting two of the landing spots but the game never directed me there before forcing me to complete the game. I got this game on sale for 13.99 and I still feel like it was kinda pricey for what you get, so I wouldn't spend full price on this game.

That being said, this is a pretty high fidelity switch-flicky button-pressey I-hope-I-don't-blow-this-thing-up type of escape room. It's a very particular niche but it felt good messing with the controls on the vessel and figuring out what they do. The game says you need to master four stations, but really you're going to spend 80% of the time at just one of them. Sadly the coolest station was the one with the tentacle on the window but I solved that room in less than two minutes and only was sent in there once. It's strange they developed this complex mech-vessel thing and created all these functions for it but didn't expand the game to actually use it in many interesting ways. By the time you have a decent gist of how to operate it, the game is almost over.

If these devs decided to go along with the name of this game and make a roguelike mode or DLC, I think this game would be incredible. The bones of this really cool machine are there but the devs are selling themselves short by making it only a one-off escape room.",1,1654877816,123,0,38

In the field of chaos, where the gridiron sprawls,
A game of football with no rules enthralls.
Hail Marys in the air, a dance of fate,
As purple and gold, with black and white, create.
Silver gleams in the snowy expanse,
The players collide in a daring dance.
No rules to bind them, a wild affair,
Bonus points decided by kicks in the air.
Touchdowns and dances, a triumphant cheer,
As the players revel in the atmosphere.
Punts go wild, could land anywhere,
In this game where the unexpected's in the air.
A person piled on, a daring leap,
In the snow so deep, secrets to keep.
Injuries forgotten in the thrill of the game,
Fumbles in the frost, each with its own name.
Purple clashes with gold in the frigid night,
A symphony of chaos, a wild delight.
Black and white weave tales in the snow,
In this football game where the bold winds blow.
The Hail Mary soars, a prayer in flight,
Deciding the game in the pale moonlight.
No rules to guide them, just the spirit of play,
In this football saga that never fades away,
On the frozen field, where X's and O's align,
A playbook unfolds, a strategy so divine.
Arrows plan the routes, a dance on the snow,
As the players follow, a choreography to show.
In the huddle's embrace, secrets are shared,
A plan for success, where victory is dared.
Blitzing through the frost, a daring feat,
Winning a first down or breaking a tie's heartbeat.
Touchdowns painted in purple and gold,
The game unfolds, a story to be told.
Black and white in pursuit, a relentless chase,
Silver gleams, the wild card in this wintery space.
Punts that spiral, defy the wind's command,
X's and O's drawn in the snow, a coach's hand.
Injuries forgotten, as the players embrace,
A dance of triumph in this chaotic space.
A person piled on, a snow-covered mound,
Fumbles in the frost, scattered all around.
The thrill of the game, no rules to bind,
In this football saga, where chaos and strategy entwined.
So in this frozen ballet of silver and gold,
X's and O's, a tale to be told.
A game where the unexpected holds sway,
In this football saga, where legends play.",1,1621049147,0,0,208

It's a fun little game. At the time of me writing this, there aren't too many levels yet, but it's a very fun premise that I'm surprised hasn't really been explored much.

Level design is pretty solid. Makes use of a lot of different types of mechanics that play to the double-player premise.

The game also has a very nice art style. It's a nice plus to have two really colorful, cute characters to look at while you stew over how to beat the next section. lol

[b] Summary: [/b]  

Look, you may see the 2 dollar price tag on this game and immediately dismiss it because “oh, it's probably nothing of note”. Don't. Sure, you can beat the game under two hours, but it's about the quality of the two hours in question. The fact is that this a smartly designed physics based puzzler that not only has a good pace of puzzles, but can lead to some hilarious moments thanks to a little bit of luck being involved. Don't get me wrong, you'll still need to use your head as thinking things out slowly but surely will reward you as you manipulate the rotation to get the desired speed you need 

While I'd say the creepiness factor compared to other AppSir games is a bit on the smaller side in this case, the story while brief has a good layers, and the game was still able to put me on edge and got me reasonably at one point. Granted, this game is on iOS and the Play Store, but I also think that the controls may work better here despite having slight issues with very minor directional changes. The sound design is eerie and yet gives you the tools you need for feedback.

Really, it's a great game that shouldn't be looked at for it's price or it's length, but just a packed experience that helps show off what smaller developers can do.

[*] Story doesn't get in the way, but is cute and does make you think a tiny bit.
[*] Gets you at least once with a good scare.

[*] At the very minute controls, you can have situations where you launch the ball off accidently.
[*] I think it's purposeful, but sometimes you get moments where the loading takes a little longer then normal (nothing bad, but like an extra 2-3 seconds) that can get annoying..
[*] Wish it had a credits screen button to see the credits again? I'm really digging for things here.

5206,1475420,"I play EVERYTHING AppSir! Ever since I played DERE EVIL EXE, I had to play the other games and piece together the story. It's one of the things that keeps me coming back. AppSir is an excellent dev, and their games are no exception! This one was probably the toughest of their catalogue, but the satisfaction that came with beating it was way above par! I'm definitely looking forward to more. I have played everything they have released, including old demos, the old Genesis game, the 3D demo where you explore a haunted house (I can't remember the name off hand), and all the others that I could find, I highly recommend everything this dev team puts out. Thank you for creating such incredible titles! Most triple A games don't have the heart and soul your games do. I feel the exact same way about Ska Studios, and it would be neat to see them collaborate on a game sometime, if that ever were a possibility. 

The mechanic of figuring out the physics of the paddles, for the first chapter of the game, felt like I was gonna hate life the further I got. However, that was far from the truth! I eventually got really good at it, and the challenges kept up with me. Very intuitive programming! Excellent work! Keep pumping these out! Looking much forward to DERE VENGEANCE!!!!! :D",1,1644835289,157,0,3

5208,1475420,"Probably the most fun of the Appsir games because of the fluid controls and usual quirky weirdness. There's not much of a story and that's fine because the stories in these games are nonsensical. In between flipping a ball to a doorway while avoiding skulls, wizards and an anime schoolgirl with bird wings, you will get instructions from AIDA who starts out giving you the correct instructions before deliberately trying to sabotage your playing. I wish this aspect of the game was a little more complex but beyond that there are some interesting puzzles in this game.

There are multiple solutions to each puzzle and, while it is mostly trial and error guiding the ball to the goal, it's still satisfying when your flip actually does what's intended and it goes in there. The best puzzle in the game involves using portals to bring the ball to hyperspeed and send it flying across the stage. Highly satisfying for how simple it is. The music and atmosphere is great too. The story, as I said is a bunch of nonsense but it's also pretty funny and the anime bird girl is probably the best character in this game series.",1,1722897902,82,82,135
5209,1475420,"This is a physics-based puzzle game of sorts.  While the gameplay was great, it was the story that won my heart.  It was a fun--and funny--story.  This is a shorter game, but it does offer its fair share of very challenging levels.  There are even some amazing surprises at the end.  I will not spoil them, but they do present a highly relevant ethical dilemma and pose the question: How much can we trust A.I.? Hilarious game. Fun game. Highly recommended.",1,1687496489,116,0,200

5212,1475420,"AppSir has developed a series that has many games under its belt. They have continually proved again and again that there is far more to their games than it seems, by connecting each and every one of them.
The rest of the games on steam have been platformers, this one changes things up by being more of a puzzle game that sort of resembles golf. This change doesn't some out of nowhere however, the story explains just how and why the change was made. While I do prefer the gameplay of the dere.exe games, this one makes up for the simple gameplay just with the story it tells. As usual this game is incredibly story and lore rich for the series and I love it.
I highly recommend what I refer to as the AppSir series, the games are always cheap and well worth the price for the ever expanding story.",1,1619366706,145,0,11
5213,1475400,"Whimsical and funny take on the prop hunt genre.

Special powers give both the hunters and the hunted different options to use to help them.  The game rounds are quick and when you are captured you join the hunters so it more interesting than just sitting in spectator mode after you are captured and makes the game more challenging for the props lucky (or clever) enough to be left.

Not sure what else to say.  The game is fun, it may not be one you play for hours on end, depending on you tastes but even so it will at least be a nice way to kill an hour at a time.

The game just went free to play but imo was worth the price when it was $10.  It only suffers from a lack of players so going free was the right move,  There are still some in game item you an purchase to give the devs some support, the best of both worlds:  free to play but some special cosmetic items or a supporter pack you can purchase if you like the game.  While there are a few special golden items that are part of this, all of the other cosmetics are purchasable by in game currency that you get from playing so you are not stuck with only the default models.

Give this really  fun little game a try, you have nothing to lose- the price is right and the download is very small!!!",1,1627164912,665,0,12

5218,1475460,"Tower defence crossed with light elements of deck building.

Lots of different classes with distinct playstyles. This is amplified further as you  pair up your main class with a second class and will need to alter your playstyle and the cards you draft accordingly. There is definitely a high degree of replayability here.

The main issues I've found so far are:
- Can't place cards when paused
- Unable to see cards in your deck or discard pile
- The game seems too easy (but supposedly a hard mode is coming in 2021)

These can impact on the fluidity of gameplay but the developers have been extremely active so if you are a prospective buyer, don't be to worried about this.",1,1609458617,958,0,11

5221,1475460,"Charming, entertaining, and fun! It vaguely reminds me of Plants vs Zombies, before it became terrible. There's some neat versatility to the character cards, and the class you choose as the 'lead' actually has a pretty huge impact on playstyle. I was pretty tepid on Farmer for instance, until I choose them as the primary class, and oh boy are all those chickens fun.

Additional content for early access is always welcome, though I think the UI needs a bit of work. Being unable to play cards while paused is probably the biggest problem for me; later stages can get pretty chaotic, and trying to make sure I've grabbed the right card from a hand of a dozen of them can lead to a panicked mess.",1,1607041201,579,0,64
5222,1475460,"It is kind of a hybrid of between Plant vs Zombie and Slay the spire. I would say it is like 80% Plant and 20% Slay.

Interesting and fun for a little while.  However, once you played through a couple of cycles, you will realized there are not much to it, there are too little depths with the game. It doesn't have much builds per class, it is pretty much just a single good build per main hero. Some classes just doesn't make sense or interesting to play. the developers should condense those classes into less heroes instead of having a bunch of classes but most likely rubbish and uninteresting. The game also forces you to keep point and click due to the nature of real time battle... very weird.

Also, the game is too easy so if you are hardcore Slay the spire and STS alike games, this might not be too enjoyable for you but if you are just getting into roguelike deckbuilding games, this is an ok entry point so you wont get too discouraged (this game is really easy and doesn't have much builds varieties, if at all).

",0,1639290204,596,0,51
5223,1475460,"This is a cool concept, I like this game.  The game is fun and the variation in class options is pretty good, though there is definitely some overlap.  One of my favorite elements in how different the game becomes when you pair up different heroes.  

I've beaten the game through all 12 floors which took about eight or nine hours (my play time is inflated by AFK)  so I have to say the game is pretty easy overall.  It's definitely not a hard TD / rogue like, but it for sure has its charm and it's frenetic challenging moments.

I'd definitely recommend this game, straight up. But I won't deny it, I think there are other games out there with much more polish and substance for a similar price point.  There's room for improvement in terms of the UI and menus.  Depending on the class you pick it can be tough to pick and play the card you want quickly, and you can't queue up cards in pause mode.  Another issue is that the number of enemies is definitely too low.  Their themes are really really good IMO, but the game should have double or triple the amount.  The enemy types just loop after the fourth floor I think so while it gets tougher by the number of enemies they throw at you, it could be way cooler if difficulty increased by actual enemy design.

All that being said the dev is actively working and updating the game.  Really enjoyed this will come back to it depending on updates that come down the road.  Cheers!",1,1607895987,807,0,10
5224,1475460,"It's a modern take on Plants vs Zombies. You race through a number of 3-minute rounds with increasing difficulty to win a game. It takes some of the roguelike elements of games like Slay the Spire; card-based actions with a tendency to be a choose-three between cards, options and upgrades.

There are some permanent upgrades and a lot of heroes (main cards) to unlock. It's replayable but very simplistic and mildly unbalanced in its current state. For example when you collect three of a hero during the game, they combine to form a more advanced version of that hero. However this is a net loss when you first achieve this, because the three bodies protecting your three lanes becomes one body protecting a single lane.

From my perspective the game looks like it's gone a bit too wide and not deep enough. I don't feel satisfied with the way I can use my heroes, and the upgrades I can utilise. For example they have an option to half your drop rate for loot inside a round to in turn have it picked up automatically. This is a tax on the lazy. It doesn't make sense as an idea because it's not changing the way the player approaches the game, but on whether they want to invest the effort into something (i.e. manually pickup drops).

If you're interested in the concept, or the novelty, I'd recommend getting it The bones of the game is good and there's a lot to like about it. The game is worth playing. There's just a lot that can be worked on.",1,1637141932,34,0,106

Some balancing issues after each round can be improved; I feel like modifying a card is almost never a good selection. I wish there was more variety with enemies such as lands and levels to travel to. Also a shop or ability to thin out or remove cards would be awesome. I also have some difficulties enacting cards sometimes; I will try to play a card on a tile and it will fail and then I will try to play it again and it will work the 2nd or 3rd time.

5289,1475580,"I wasn't sure about purchasing this Add-On. I usually have bad experiences when I get add-ons, regarding performance issues, poorly made scenaries and buses, etc.

I must say, this one is really well made. Yes, it wasn't a really good idea to put it on the market and hours later you couldn't play it anymore. It should have been planned better, but shit happens. 

Don't let this puntual issue influence the purchase of this add-on. 

If you are tired of driving always in a german city, driving always under 70km/h, with the same buses all over again, I think this is your add-on. 

You drive through lots of diferent places: from a technology campus, through a road between towns, some motorways, lots of special bus lines and roundabouts. From a driver perspective, sometimes it gets challenging, and I love that. I think I will spend a lot of time driving this map. 

From the perfomance point of view, I must say it runs perfectly, I could complete the lines without any crashes at all. It's not very very smooth on the FPS, but it's stable all along the route. 
I hate that about other addons, where you get 30fps in some places and then 15 in other. This one, in that sense, is very well made, where, in my case, I get stable 20-25fps. 

It comes with a big variety of buses, which surprises me. Nevertheless, the MAN gearbox is broken, works very unrealistic. But I don't really care, I have still 2 well made buses to go. I hope they solve that, but at least you don't depend on that one bus. 

The scenary it's beautiful. You can tell you are in another country, and not always stuck in Spandau. The only thing I noticed they got from another Add-on, is the U-Bahn entrance of the St. Pauli station of Hamburg. That was really unexpected. 

The announcements are in french, and most of the voices too. Sometimes you here a robotic female voice or a german screaming at you because it is too cold/hot/dark in the bus. But I think that's a minor thing, the 80% of the time you get a ""bonjour"" and a ""merci"", and hope it get's to the 100% in the future with coming updates.

However, as others have said, it also suffers from lag and stutters, and at times is all but unplayable.  We all know this can happen in OMSI, even if you have a NASA-type computer, and performance is dependent on tweaking all the settings.  I normally use a settings plan that gives reasonable results in, for instance, X10 Berlin. This map won't run well on those settings, but rather than ask for a refund, I've decided to keep it and mess around with different parameters to see if I can improve performance.

5299,1475580,"There are a lot of bad reviews here for poor performance, personally i have experienced a few crashes and things but overall the FPS for seems a lot better than other DLC routes. 

This DLC is a fictional spin off of the real life 91.06, 91.10 and 91.11 in this area of Essonne. Coming with 4 variations to the 91.06, 91.06 C and D terminate at Plateu du Moulon and A and B continuing to the Cormeilies Terminus. lines B and C go via the fictional Airbus Campus and an area taking a bit of inspiration from whats there in real life. 

The DLC also comes with several other lines which give a lot of variety, there are plenty of great looking small villages. You can find more details on the DLC pages website. 

Another thing i look about the DLC though is there is not too much going on, there isn't too many assets and the routes are pretty easy to get a mental image of the whole map after just driving for a bit. Which is something you just don't get on DLCs like Saint Servan for example. 

And the Bus priority (BRT i suppose not sure what word they use in france) sections of the route are all very well implemented fun to drive in my opinion.

There is also a pretty decent network of a motorway and roads for deadruns to and from the depots. 

The DLC comes with decent busses, namely the Mercedes based C2, and the MAN A23. 

Other DLCs busses are also quite good to use on this route such as the iveco DLCs and the Heuliz ones.

Excellent scenery and buses together with short to long haul lines which is also great. 

WHAT I DISLIKE
The only problem is performance issues where it lags at some places. Well, as long as you have the patience to keep tweaking your game settings until performance is slightly improved.

PRICING
Pricing for that amount of money isn't bad in my opinion considering the detail of the map alongside with a variety of lines and buses to drive on.

UPDATE?

5310,1475580,"This map is an impressive size with expansive and varied scenery and yet it disappoints in some on some of the fundamentals on the map design and execution.

Pros:-
1. Timetable lengths are realistic (no 18hr continuous driving shifts, most are around 8 hours driving which seems reasonably realistic, most have breaks too during that time)
2. The depots are depicted so you can do a dead run at the start and end of the day
3. Some good high speed bus driving and the motorway driving appears to be good with no drivers turning into your path
4. Dead runs during peak hours to deal with higher patronage in one direction
5. It's a huge map, it contains the route of the free 18.06 DLC and alot more.

Cons:-
1. Bounding boxes for some of the scenery objects are wrong, meaning you hit certain objects without being anywhere close to them (I've been on a killing spree in the editor deleting overhead motorway signposts and problematic streetlamps, but it's not completely broken that I can't play without collisions on.)
2. Performance on this map is low and can be stuttery with slow loading textures in places sometimes. (par for the course for an OMSI map, I do get better performance than the London DLC though).
3. As per the above, the AI vehicles have been completely stripped to the bare minimum with black opaque windows, a little disappointing but I don't know the performance benefit of that.
4. Occasional spawning and disappearing of cars in certain intersections due to broken pathing.
5. The passengers have a mix of german and french and some (the kids in particular) have two different voices, one for the greeting and another for the asking of the ticket.

Overall if you can deal with the lag and either turn off collisions or do what I did and start deleting collision prone objects you will likely enjoy the map, ignoring and working around its shortfalls it's a pretty decent map, the problem is it's difficult to ignore it's downfalls, too many times I turn my head on a roundabout to see if a vehicle is coming and the game will freeze for 10 seconds whilst it loads textures, makes it difficult to judge speed when a vehicle is frozen and I get anxious if I'm in the path of the car or turning a corner whilst it happens.

It gets a weak recommendation from me, I can work with the cons and I found the map fun.

Someone needs to fix the bounding boxes on the scenery objects, particularly the overhead signage (the pole holding up the signs is triggering a collision when I go under it) on the motorway near the transdev depot and the streetlamps on the onramp heading towards the motorway to the transdev depot. There's also another collision somewhere else but I haven't figured out what it is yet and I couldn't easily mention where it is at the present time.",1,1632898779,0,0,6

The map is wonderfully built, with the assets done to a high standard, even with objects that have 3d text on the somehow not making my (quite dated by today's standards) PC chug like a steam engine that's about to explode.

The buses are quite nice, though the optimisation varies between them, mainly since they were made by different devs who take a different take on bus construction. I find myself driving the MAN A25G and the C2 NGT more, but that's cause of my personal preference.

5343,1475830,"Look, I'm happy to ""donate"" to Keen by buying DLC to fund continued development. But this DLC is a joke, and it mainly has to do with the Passage blocks.

I've been waiting for an expansion to Passage blocks for a while, because they make interiors easier to build and look so much better. Until now I've been using the PassageIntersections mod, which comes with a whole range of options, like passages with windows, passages with vents, passages with conveyors, passages with integrated doors, stairwells, etc. 

Meanwhile, the official Passage set in this DLC doesn't even have corners. It has a 4-way intersection, a lit hallway, a wall, and whatever a ""frame"" is. There isn't even a lit variant of each, just the one lit hallway. The models don't visually mesh with any of the existing doors, either, and even the different styles of passage don't mix well. 

Stranger still, the free bits of the update include two ""Passage 2"" blocks - a wall and an unlit hallway - but they're in a different style than the paid DLC ""Passage 3"" blocks, so the two sets don't even complement each other. Want a lit hallway with the ""Passage 2"" aesthetics? Too bad.

It boggles my mind how poorly thought out this DLC is. Sure, the armory block is cool, and the windows are nice if a little flimsy-looking, but you can't include something as useful as a Passage set, and then forget to include a vast majority of the necessary pieces to make the set usable.

I know that many times DLCs are a cash grab but splitting a DLC into multiple parts is a whole new level.

The content offered by the DEVs is very limited.

The price is ok (like always), well what you pay is what you get... I would gladly pay 5 times more in order to get actual content.

Well I honestly dont know what to write anymore...from one side is the love I have for the game, I want to see it develop and grow... on the other side I guess Im just disappointed.

5349,1475830,"[u]Update Review (not part of DLC final score):[/u]
Keen added much needed basic features such as a reload animation and some weapon variety over two years after Space Engineers ""released"". Better late than never I guess but it seems like they could have spent more time. The pistol doesn't tilt back when under recoil and instead just kinda jitters a tiny bit. The actual weapon variety still feels lacking. They could have at least added a shotgun. For an update to handheld weapons, this feels far from definitive and for what is here, it came way too late for a ""released game"". Since it's unlikely Keen is going to touch handheld weapons again to either add more or improve the animations, I'm relatively disappointed. I do enjoy the update and think it's still an improvement over what we had but it could have and should have been more. Currently the update feels slightly above minimum viable product for a on-foot combat overhaul. It needed more development time. The training dummy is impressive though and I hope Keen keeps making more content like it by adding more blocks with new functions.


[u]DLC Review:[/u]
Pay to win firing slit and passageway expansions without a base game equivalent makes this DLC far from ""cosmetic only"". 

Still can't use the emotes and skins from the DLC offline because Keen in their infinite wisdom has decided to make suit skins, block skins, and emotes Steam Inventory items. We can't trade or sell these items so it's completely pointless to have this restriction. 

For the pay-to-win elements and continued decision to make suit skins, block skins, and emotes Steam Inventory items (and thus only usable when you are able to connect to the steam inventory server), I'd say the DLC is a 3/10. If I were to include the update in the score, it would be higher but not by much considering that this is likely the last time Keen will touch handheld weapons. Considering the total cost of all DLC right now (excluding Deluxe) is ~$30 and the game is $20, it's becoming fatiguing to play Space Engineers. 

Ultimately it's $4 for passageways that arguably should have been in the game and a firing slit that either never should have been added or if it was should have been available to everyone. What's left is an ugly skin (that you can only use if you are connected to the Steam inventory servers), two decent emotes (that you can only use if you are connected to the Steam inventory servers), some half height walls and windows (which feel limited in use, especially the windows), and a weapon rack that is still inferior in functionality to the one made by Eikester (unlike the one in the DLC, his allows you to store weapons and have those weapons appear visually on it). If you're a completionist like me, get it. But if you're anyone else, it doesn't seem to add much stuff you'd use often except the passageways and firing slit which are both content that should exist in the base game.",0,1619423671,0,0,14
5350,1475830,"People seem to fail to realize that Keen is 100% open about the available content and even share pics/gifs of whats included. All DLC so far has pretty much been a few cosmetic blocks (some of which are REALLY welcome and useful for designs) and in some cases like this, emotes or scenarios or some other extras. None of which effect gameplay really, and won't give you an edge.

Honestly the price is reasonable to support further development, and compared to companies like Paradox who charge $10-20 for each DLC which often also only contain a few cosmetics and extras, but also remake or even mess up the gameplay you're used to, I would say SE's DLC is some of the most fair DLC out there and I have bought almost all of them at this point.",1,1619398074,0,0,67
5351,1475830,"I have purchased all of the DLC for this game, and this one takes the cake in disappointment!

But this one, I have absolutely no use for!  Took me about 5 minutes to conclude that I wasted my money.  I love this game, but I don't know if I want to keep supporting it?  I do not recommend this DLC!!

Edit:  With the patch that released on the 20th of may, Keen tried to amend the DLC with a few extra blocks!  Well, my review still stands, not much improved.

5352,1475830,"I just don't know who this DLC is for. It adds very few things, and they're ... kind of rushed? 

Example: the DLC introduces more passages (clearly a rip-off of the popular player mod). The mod extends the base game's single passage type ('passage 1'), but the mod introduces 2 new types of passage, 'passage 2' and 'passage 3', both of which are wholly incomplete, leaving the base game's single passage block as-is. No passage has a floor, and there is no block type that works as a floor. There is no way to get air into a passage.

Passage 2 and passage 3 are clearly modelled by different artists, and do not work well together. Passage 3 is gorgeous, but only has four variants: lit, unlit, half, and a 4 way intersection. Passage 2 only has 2 variants, a half version and a full version. This DLC provides no way of making any kind of corner, two way, or three way with a passage. Since passage 2 has no lit version, it is impossible to see anything in them. There are no passages with windows, and the passages don't fit on any of the game's doors all that well.

It's a recommend from me, but I'm biased.

Who the hell thought it was a good idea to turn the games piece of ♥♥♥♥ - barely usable guns into even bigger pieces of ♥♥♥♥, which have ridiculous recoil and are way more difficult to handle?

For ♥♥♥♥'s sake KEEN... here's some advice.

1. slap your ""creative lead"" or whoever is responsible for deciding what to upgrade and slap them in the face. Do this repeatedly.

2. find whoever thought "" we should prevent uranium from spawning on planets "" and slap them in the face. Then make uranium spawn on planets.

3. find whoever half-arsedly implemented that in-game ""IDE"" and slap them in the face. While at it, find whoever decided to nerf the entire API because ""anti-grief in multiplayer "" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ without allowing an option to actually use all code in the game, and .... you guessed it... PUNCH this mf in the face. this guy deserves more than a slap.

... also, the person who's responsible for locking out NPC ""AI"" from the rest of the API because it uses "" dangerous"" code or resources ... <---- this guy... slap this guy in the face ... with a shovel.

4. Find whoever beta-tested the mechanics of the gun and slap them in the face, then fire them.

Actually ... why don't you just do yourselves a favor and slap yourselves in the face repeatedly? If it wouldn't knock some sense into you people, it'd, at the very least, feel exactly like having to witness how this game that was once filled with potential slowly and consistently turn into a worse-than-generic piece of garbage.

... can't believe you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are charging money for chest-high walls.

When you're done slapping yourselves....

1. range finder block. I'm guessing you guys tried to implement this at some point but failed and just gave up because there's code in the camera that can be used (or at least could be used at some point... but i'm pretty confident assuming one of you decided to fuck that up as well.)

2. symmetry in non-creative. ... why in the fuck is this not a thing? is it because you're too busy re-skinning mods to work out some actual features?

3. suit upgrades. more inventory if you sink a bunch of credits(another idiotic idea) or resources in it... say 50000 tons of gold for buying an inventory size upgrade from one of the stations would actually give us a reason to go there.

4. rocket launcher projectiles should not self destruct. ... or if they must because you can't be bothered to optimize the game, they should do so after 20km.

5. either fix that blasted IDE or allow us to use some sort of folder monitoring to capture changes in a file in order to debug our scripts.

6. blueprint options to only show non-armor blocks, or only armor, or only specific types of blocks, etc. ...

... it took more time to write points 1 through 6 than to think about things this game actually needs instead of embratures or whatever the hell that block is called. ... seriously.. what the hell are you people doing?

This update was disappointed to say the least I was expecting a full range of FPS weapons with LMGs, SMGS, snipers, pistols, and some sort of heavy weapon, but all we got was the pistol and the rocket launcher. Another thing that would have been the perfect thing to add to this update that im sad Keen didn't was armor for engineers but that one was something I kinda expect not to see.

Update and DLC blocks-
Another point of this update that disappointed me was the clear pandering to the DLC blocks. Now I have purchased the DLC because I love this game and want to support it but I also want people (especially the builder types) who don't want to spend more money than the base price to enjoy the game. The old passage way 1 hasn't had any variants added and the new free passage way 2 has only 2 variants added to the game, on the other hand the DLC passage way 3 has had so many very interesting variants added such as a 4 way connection and a passage way with a LIGHT (srsly a passage way with a light is big for builders). I feel as tho that both passage way 1 and 2 should have those variants added to the game so that people can enjoy and build without block limitations.
And my last point on blocks is there is missing corner passage ways that Keen should have added.

Summary-
This update both lacks in content and disappointingly looks like a shill for money (tho i dont think it is). Which hurts more especially when Keen promised to keep DLCs as only extra stylistic blocks and keep all game-play content and key building blocks free in updates.",0,1619374768,0,0,2

As everyone else has said the new passage blocks from this pack are very basic and don't blend well with the ""free"" passage blocks, nor each other. The new skin might be your taste, but personally it isn't mine. I normally build a lot on planets so the only thing I really recommend is the new cover blocks. Kinda gives a more castle/fortress feel having bunkers and pill boxes that look more realistic now. It's sad that I have to waste $4 just for a few cover blocks that aren't even really that great, but if you're not as picky as me with your base matching the new passage blocks might be a good pick-up also. 

Dear Keen,
I've bought every DLC for space engineers minus the concept pack and if you ask me you're just p****** on us now. When you first started dropping these DLC's I understood you needed money to continue development and I liked how it wasn't mandatory for everyone to own the DLC's to play together, they were mainly a cosmetic item/block. I will say though each DLC you release after another is just upsetting your fan base. Add some decent blocks, skins, or mechanics and I'll be happy to buy. Don't sell me a pack that you describe as a great buy, but really is mostly a pile of garbage. You already have a terrible record for games and the one fan base that is keeping you afloat you're p****** off. Really hope you put effort into ""Warfare 2.""",0,1619406827,0,0,1

I found  an animation glitch in the new DLC I would of reported the error using steam but they moved that off steam which seems not honest so I am posting it in negative review. If you hit ""R"" for reload you can detach the hand on the front of the rifle so it looks like your hand is poking through the gun https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2465135262

The blocks are sort of Meh they are a nice addition but for the price mods can do the same. I feel the Cheep low exception DLC are a marketing trick. I would pay over $25 for something amazing like targeting systems 10km , lasers, 5KM+ weapons or homing missiles. Mini-Blocks for spawing weapons with remotes that track targets to make sub grid sized weapon systems. Even a stupid map and compass would make planets more fun.
Go watch the expanse for 10 minutes and give us combat like that.

	[td][h1]Cool DLC but ABSOLUTELY TRASH [/h1]
This DLC absolutely limited for being more creative due to insufficient  items for small gird👎👎Just made the refund. I don't even want to give a penny to @KEEN anymore. Keen is taking the game in the wrong way. Supper disappointed with this DLC cuz 99% of items in this DLC usable for Large gird (big ship) ............................. wut the hell!  
So what for small gird ????   just gun shelf?  hell ya refunded.   @Keen u are going wrong path. This cube game has extremely low design materials even needs more basic stuff. Instead of the gun shelf and bunch of wall windows, add some  small grid size  stuff  such as Sofa, Gravity Generator, Jukebox, Jump Drive, Small Antenna Dish, Multi-floor Elevator, Flat Landing Gear, Power Lines, Cables, Magnet block (Sticky surface)  Decoration pack and more....!@ 
Every time I reach them via their Live stream they say open ticket for KEEN send request there and guess what there will never ever respond to it .......still no answer for the first ticket I wrote 3 years ago ... I wrote many tickets there...... they always say we love to hear and get recommendations but absolutely they don't give  ♥♥♥♥. This cube shape game makes me boring.  SE is the space version of Minecraft literally CUBE [] []  .......need to be buried SE in the steam library forever🗑️ ☠️[/td]

Story is good, captivating and based on a real Brazilian history. Characters are relatable, you can easily understand their motivations given the context and the way they develop with the story is excellent.

Combat got me a bit bamboozled by a couple rounds, but once i figured it out it was quit enjoyable. Some enemies can be quite a handful and asymmetrical battles are quite common.

Some puzzles' cues felt a bit confusing at first, but i guess that's what a puzzle is all about. :P

I just have one criticism up to the moment: please add a dialog 'log' (latest 10  dialog boxes) or a 'current objective' on menu, I lost the count of how many times i simply got distracted and forgot what to do and had no way of getting to the dialogs or objectives.

5440,1475890,"What a unique experience. I was very impressed with the mature and insightful look into the history and culture around slavery in Brazil, as well as the Mandinga and Yoruba peoples represented by the main characters. The overall narrative was strong and the characters were well written. I really enjoyed the exploration of religion (Islam and Isese), psychology, and clashing cultures between the main characters. These factors alone make the game well worth the time. That said, I feel that I should mention that the game takes an rather unflinching look at slavery -- physical and sexual abuse are both present in the game. I believe they were used appropriately, but it's something to be aware of.

The moment to moment gameplay is serviceable. The battle system revolves around building sets of dice for each character and choosing the right one to use each turn. It offers a good amount of customizability given the scope of the game, and I found it to be more engaging than straight up menu based JRPG combat. Random battles are grating, but it was tolerable given the game's short run time.

The pixel art for the moment to moment gameplay is just decent, but I really enjoy the more detailed illustrations that show up in some places such as character portraits, special moves in combat, and dream sequences.  These really bring out the game's unique voice.

There are some major QA issues here, though. I was able to walk out of bounds on a couple of occasions, some objects that looked like they should have collision didn't, and so on. The translation was a bit spotty -- the phrasing wasn't quite right and a few things here and there didn't even get translated (e.g. accept and cancel in menus). Some of the sound effects are bad samples that would have stuck out in the 90s. Luckily, none of these basic technical issues impeded my progress through the game or detracted from the overall message and story.

There is one issue that did detract from the experience, though. A narrative split occurs a few hours in. Since the game only keeps a single save file, you'd have to replay the initial shared portion to check out the other side of the split. I'm not interested in doing that, but I am interested in seeing more of the details on the side I didn't choose. Not huge, since I think I could largely infer what happened, but still a bit disappointing.

If you're able to look past these types of issues and the overall lack of polish, the game is absolutely worth experiencing. It'll definitely stick with me for a long time, and, at the end of the day, that's why I love indie games like Mandinga so much.",1,1673051225,402,0,126
5441,1475890,"This game, it tells an awesome story, with utterly relatable characters. You can really understand their cause and their motivation. All of that with some amazing art work and a great soundtrack.  The combat system is really cool, too.

Some minor issues I had:
It does have one or two bugs that don't really matter too much (nothing game breaking or anything like that). 
Some of the combat moves take a bit long to execute, (but they do look really cool, so it\s ok)
Some of the translation into english isn't quite on point (everything is understandable, though, so you'll probably be fine understanding what's going on and where to go and what to do).

So, totally worth the experience to play this game.",1,1651360712,490,0,4
5442,1475890,"I enjoyed my time with it, it has a unique setting and gameplay. The combat system is fine, with the deck building allowing a good amount of customization, the only real problem i had with the gameplay is that there is no option to skip animations and battles tend to drag a bit thanks to both the long animations but also the randomness of the dice rolls. This wasn't too much of an issue for most of the game, except for the segment where the protagonists split up, where having only one character made combat really slow. The english translation is mostly fine, but every now and then the buttons for accepting would be in portuguese, and at one point a character's dialog had code in it. Overall a pretty nice game and anyone interested in it's setting should check it out.",1,1633223251,429,0,8
5444,1474940,"Royal Roads 2 is an abandoned mobile app that's been dumped on Steam as a paid product, as if it was a real PC game (it's not)... it's a cash grab from greedy mobile devs and asset flip copy + paste shovelware game pushers at 8Floor. These guys have dumped reskins of the same games literally hundreds of times onto Steam, polluting the place and making gaming worse for everyone. And this mobile app of theirs is no exception.

Royal Roads 2 is a pointless ""12 Labours of Hercules"" screen tapper/clicker mobile app.  There's no gameplay, just tapping on the screen.  The mobile app is made to look like you're making interesting decisions as you're presented with a map of a town/village/pathway that has you clicking on various things to collect things which are then consumed when you click on an obstacle, which unlocks more things to click on.  This is so lame and shallow, you could write a script to randomly click the screen and given enough time, it would beat the game.

The shady developer behind this valueless shovelware has proven to be a persistent nuisance abusing Steam Direct... they've dumped over a hundred valueless mobile app tier asset flips onto Steam, many featuring plagiarised/stolen stock art and other unethical, shady behaviours. 

The developer, Creobit/8Floor, has copy + pasted this particular game, with minor reskins, an insane THIRTY TWO TIMES onto Steam... why cash in on one asset if you can cash in on multiple copies of the same game? Asset flipping begins at home! Here's a list of 8Floors's copy + pastes of this asset:

[i]These are all reskins of exactly the same game![/i]  What value is there in this spam/pollution glutting the Steam store for gamers?  This valueless copy + paste garbage is taking up marketing space for genuine indie developers who are doing the right thing.  It's harmful to the industry and to gamers.

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The mobile app features simple, cartoony 2D graphics, of the type you normally expect to see in low effort mobile apps.  3D graphics programming does require a degree of skill and competence and unfortunately not all developers have the budget or talent to deliver this, despite 3D graphics cards hitting the mainstream in the 1990's.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this mobile app is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 6 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality mobile app is to be expected.

You can play better games like this for free on mobile phones, it's impossible to recommend anyone pays the ridiculous price tag for this asset flip on Steam.  It's just a nasty cash grab.",0,1715918661,74,0,12189

NEUTRAL - mouse only / you unlock different scenarios kites colors and characters with little differences 
CONS - after around 2 hours I reached level 120 tried every scenario kite and character and started to get repetitive but it's similar to some basic mobile games so kind of no wonder afterall that it gets tedious",1,1683662753,132,0,495
5456,1475080,"This game is super simple, but it is indeed relaxing, and surprisingly addictive! 
You just tap the mouse button to make the kite go up, which dodges whatever clouds, birds, leaves, etc. are floating past you. Each level, you have to dodge more objects to win, but I don't think the difficulty really increases much. 
You can unlock kites of different speeds, and choose the one you like, in order to make it easier or harder.
The graphics are not particularly impressive, but it's quite aesthetically pleasing anyhow. It's minimalist and pretty, with a variety of different colour palettes available.
The rhythmic click sound of success each time you successfully dodge something is kind of hypnotic, especially coupled with the ambient sounds of the different levels.  
Your can choose the background and soundscape that you like, and change it anytime, once unlocked. The levels are not fixed or ordered. 
You can hear things like rainstorm, beach, lake with loons, tropical jungle birds, windy drippy cave, or a couple different kinds of music.  The soundscapes are attached to your scenery choice. 
This is a good game to play if I'm feeling anxious and just want to shut off my brain for a bit.
My one complaint is the rapid blinging coin counting sound effect at the end of every level... It's a loud, annoying sound that's kind of jarring after zoning out to nature sounds. I wish you could turn off just that one sound effect!",1,1617333053,366,0,4

EDIT2: AFTER LOOKING AT THE FIRST GAME I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS the game only has 3 levels and after looking at the reviews at  the original moi mei games it seems the creator makes bad games then receives positive reviews that are inaccurate.
full disclosure edit: (I really feel the build that they have out right now should have been a prologue or a demo to get some free play testing on the game instead of releasing it for a price in the state it's in if the game's not updated within a day or two I may refund it since they did release it at a price highly incomplete instead of taking the demo route.) I suspect I will be changing my review in the future if it's updated but as it is right now I would wait it's only got 3 levels which are very introductory not much puzzling going on so far. There's no story added to the game as of yet and it feels insanely clunky I'm hoping they'll change her movement/how it feels she interacts with the environment she feels like she gets stuck on everything and her jump is just awk. Again I got this just as it released hopefully it'll shape into a more enjoyable game in the future but right now I would not purchase it. I'll change the review as the game updates if it ever becomes that enjoyable game I hope it does.",0,1608197646,7,0,992

5499,1475200,"it's fun to play, good mechanics. it's worth buying but only if you know it feels like a tech demo, and you're making an investment that maybe it will be good one day. i mean, for 10 bucks it's worth a couple hours of fun. but there's a lot of problems.

defense is impossible. the movement needs to be reworked to be slower, it's like trying to defend a basketball player who can strafe on a dime like quake. 

the ball has no physics off the hoop. none. it drops like a rock. and 9/10 times you will kick it out of bounds or let it roll out of bounds because no matter how hard you try you will not pick the ball up off the ground.

this is easily the worst feature: the ball doesn't bounce (which makes rebounds and loose balls weird af) and you cannot pick up the ball off the ground

the netcode is terrible, playing with any ping difference is really bad. the host is fine but connecting to someone elses game feels awful. 

being left handed sucks pretty bad too, the controls are not rebindable, so it's almost impossible to move and dribble at the same time. i also find it a lot harder to dribble with the left hand regardless, i make the motion and it just doesn't happen. totally fine on the right hand.

and there's all the general controller glitches and softlocks that come with being a vr early access game.

even though i just said all those negative things about it, overall, i have to recommend it right now because it's fun with a friend to shoot around and try to pass to each other. hopefully development is going to continue to fix the netcode and rework the movement. the game has a ton of potential. if it's the last 10 dollars you have, hold onto it, but if you've got 10 to spend (and lets be honest, you play vr, you do) it's fun for a while to do your best slam dunk contest impression.",1,1615002055,172,0,1
5500,1475200,this game has baseline core mechanics and nothing beyond that. the developers have completely quit developing the game (no updates since Q3 2021) and banned me from their discord server when confronted about it. do NOT waste your money here,0,1635630506,1666,0,11
5501,1475200,"This game has loads of potential and some good bones thus far.

Im sure I'll be giving it a thumbs up very soon with a couple of updates.
 
My main issues:
1-Crashed 3 times in under a hour.

2-Physics a bit off, it takes so much to even shoot from the foul line. Yes I even adjusted the strength and jumped. 

3-Shot about 150 shots, still very hard (I could shoot way better in real life) even with the assist all the way up barely seemed to help. I like a challenge and can improve, but something is off when its hard to get a brick when I could easily hit the rim every shot in real life. I know it takes a bit of time to get it down as releasing the trigger. Arm got sore throwing the ball so hard, maybe a bit more forgiving on the release times as its much harder then in real life with a trigger thus not as fluid.

4-Played some horse and it just feels a bit empty, maybe light music or something would make it feel more lively, even a few people in bleachers booing or cheering sound effects more like sneaker sounds, louder bouncing of the ball off the ground or hoop etc can go a long way.

5-Dribbling tried seemed very hard as it bounced in angles.

PROS: 

1+ Singleplayer vs PC is a great addition because relying on MP solely is not a good idea. Maybe add 2 on 2 option as old double dribble so you can pass it to a AI. Also the option to not dribble?  3 point and free throw contests didn't try yet, but horse was a chill option.

2+ Fun factor was good shooting even if missing everything with tons of air balls.

3+ Good sim feel, just need to balance challenge but not make it too easy either unless if can just adjust assists.

4+EA so they are not done :)

6.5/10 so far with some adjusting can easily be a 9/10. Seems like the best BBall on the market at this time.",0,1626741913,120,0,447

2. The servers are bad. I know that it's early access but even if the shot assist is at 10 and I'm not in my own server, I almost always miss and it doesn't feel natural when I release the ball
3. Sprinting is way too fast. I've logged many hours into VR and this almost makes me vomit.

The game in its current state is pretty buggy, shots often fire out of your hands at 300mph in a straight line and similar effects can be had from simply trying to pick up the ball.

5553,1475200,"So I really like the Mechanics. There have been a few games that kind of played around with the idea of basketball but it was not very appealing. This game has you dribbling, Handling the ball with 2 hands pretty nicely and even dunking! You have to get used to it because at first it may seem a bit hard, bit of a learning curve... You can have shot assist and practice even on the main menu! You can play with just your friends a game of horse or 1v1 to 21 up to 2v2! I wish there were more menu options because I cannot record my gameplay from my PC because the screen resolution is off and I dont know a way to fix it. and the Tutorial got stuck on a part and would not show me more. But its EA so I imagine it will get worked on =] Great game so far I really like it! For the price it makes it even better! I can see this being more to if its worked on.

5557,1475200,"That all sounds really good! I'm really excited for it to release on Quest! I enjoy alot of the mechanics! The dribbling is a bit weird for me  since it doesn't work 100% of the time, the shooting is pretty well done but the guiding hand glitches out sometimes whenever I use it, for the power of the shooting I would dial the strength way back or put the current strength as the middle and have it so we can slide the slider to make it weaker or stronger with that strength that it's at now. The dunking and passing does seem like they need to be worked/polished a bit more, I feel like the dunking can be a bit too fast, maybe add a little floaty affect so the jumping isn't as quick! It would be alot easier with doing bounce passes if the ball was inflated more so passes can be easier. When it comes to layups I feel like it's pretty difficult to lay it off the back board since it has such a crazy bounce when you bank it from the back board and also the movement itself is really fast when your holding the stick down going towards the basket and you want to lay it up or dunk it but find myself flying past the hoop lol. One other thing I need to say is I found myself lagging a good amount when I joined a multi-player match and noticed a delay of animation when I shoot in multi-player so if you could optimize it a bit more! Other than those small gripes, Everything looks pretty good so far and I'm enjoying the game so far and I can't wait to see what you bring to this game in the future! I hope I can help this game grow!",1,1614564415,582,0,1

5560,1475200,"It takes a bit of time to get used to the shots, and the dribbling needs some work for sure. But overall it's going to be a decent basketball experience as long as you're playing it with friends. I just hope the devs put some love and care into polishing it up and making it a little less rough around the edges. For example the love/hate relationship I have with the blocks up until you smack your ball after a shot and blast it off the court. The only reason I decided to take a break was because I kept having a nasty CTD on my RIFT S that basically  crashed my entire VR a couple of times. Not sure what the trigger was though.

5561,1475250,"I have no idea why the game has no reviews... but now it will!  First of: it is adorable!  I like the cute design of everything.  Also, it is turn based.  So turn-based party RPG (I mean it says it above).  You start with one character, but the higher you go: the more you unlock.

The game is... luck based.  I lost on the first or second battle my first time around.  Then when I showed my friend how bad I was at it: I completed 1-1 area!  Afterwards I tried to lose, because if you do -> there is a score that updates and you get new skills... so I actually won Chapter 1... Go figure!

Once you progress in 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 areas: they get harder.  The enemies do.  There are also ""mini games"" where you either collect or dodge things to try and keep yourself alive.  Lots of skills to collect and your heroes actually have a skill tree... which will depend on you and your luck to pick the right one... However, once you unlock a hero character, it becomes a permanent choice.  A total of 5.

The story is a comic style panels (I think), it is simple and to the point.  It continues once you complete a chapter.  There is some of the game play footage above and if you ever did turn-based rogue games, you know what to expect.

Sometimes some of the text comes up in Spanish, but then it morphs to English.  When I select ""Windows"" and choose the resolution, it doesn't always stick.  It throws me into Full Screen mode, when I finish a run.  I have to go re-click stuffs, but not a complaint.

I hope the game gets more traction, as it looks like the Developer created an enjoyable game, so I hope there will be more good things for the Developer in the future.  Thank for the game!  :) :> =)

5562,1475260,"I don't get how this is an adventure or a mystery game. I mean the basic story isn't too bad (the characters have some good lines), but it's so short is has no build-up and no surprises. Talk to people, follow the one path, do the obvious - there is nothing I would call puzzle solving here. A Mystery needs some time do develop, some suspense...

The text bubbles are hard to read with this narrow font and this 2000-era bloom in top of it. Tried to tone it down, but the quality settings doesn't seem to do much - what I do notice though is that clicking in the menu still advances the conversations. I don't think there is a way to repeat conversations or look into a log of who said what - you know, like a notebook a reporter would use?
It's a warm day - granted - but other games don't whip my gpu into a frenzy like this. It hit 100% during the scene at the sheriff, like this night shader takes ungodly amounts of power to be rendered. 

I found the boss fight too long and unfun. The prompts for picking up items take to long to fade in or register a click. Putting up a big ""Hide here"" sign is just giving up trying to tell the player through level design or gameplay what should be done. Why is that fight in there anyway? Throwing molotov cocktails maybe a solution to a puzzle, but don't make players who want to unravel a mystery doge and hide - wrong genre!

It's a decent idea and setup for a story, but there is lots of stuff testing should've found before release.",0,1624118965,53,0,153

It is an abstract puzzle game. It makes you think in different and new ways, like a puzzle game should. I haven't figured out the logic quite yet, but I managed to beat the first 2/6 levels. 

Good to know: You don't have to beat all the achievements at once. I am wondering whether it is possible to get all the achievements without using powerups and at the same time.

I also like to play it the coming days against a non-computer competitor. I've already looked at what I need to do to play against someone else. Now I just need to find a colleague who dares to take up the fight :-)

5636,1474630,"The 1-month Old School Runescape (OSRS) membership is worth it to anybody who wants to try more of what they enjoyed during the free to play (f2p) experience. Membership simply expands the f2p experience with a significantly larger world, hundreds of more quests, and a few more skills. Some membership content has its problems, but the game makes up for this through its sheer volume of options and community. Getting OSRS membership through Steam has no downsides, and for more casual players is the better option. 

OSRS membership expands the base f2p experience with several continents of content that have been given just as much attention as f2p areas like Varrock and Falador. The new continents and countries come with quests, minigames, and lots of alternative ways to train skills. Only a very small percentage of the new content is dead or even rarely used, but the sheer amount of content in the game makes this a non-issue.

The hundreds of quests added by OSRS membership are definitely worth it. They are distributed fairly evenly across the world, require the use of a lot of skills, and often demand puzzle solving. By the standards of membership, the f2p finale quest of Dragon Slayer is a relatively simple medium sized quest with a straightforward boss. Some older quests have convoluted logic, and strange mechanics, but this can be remedied with guides and/or community help.

OSRS Membership skills are used in large number of quests, and there are lots of ways to level them. Some skills are very slow to level or extremely click intensive, and fast to level but most skills have more of a balance. Skilling as a member is generally easier as members have more ways to train skills and rarely have to compete with bots on member worlds. Membership also introduces a lot of different ways to train and use the base f2p skills. 

For more casual players who wish to take breaks from playing with membership there are no reasons not to use Steam to buy membership. Memberships purchased through Steam as DLC are one-time purchases that do not automatically renew themselves like memberships purchased through the Jagex website. Buying a membership package that does not automatically renew itself through the Jagex website involves first buying the membership and then searching through the website to find out how to cancel it.  With Steam there is no risk of accidentally buying an unwanted membership through an automatic renewal. The 1-month membership package costs the same same regardless of where it is purchased and comes with all of the same features so so there is no downside to buying membership through Steam.",1,1615926216,0,0,288

The AWSD keys are already compatible with the directional keys, and you can use the left and right mouse buttons for sprinting and sliding while on the horse (which admittedly helps quite a bit) however the game is inaccessible for me when it comes to actions such as jumping or ducking as spacebar and CTRL require me to stop using the directional keys to navigate.

5736,1474900,"[b]TLDR[/b]: very little to do, unless you meticulously scan locations for notes. The story is almost non-existent and presented in pieces. Few real puzzles, feels more like a hidden objects game. Bad English voice acting.


This game has been in my wishlist for a year or so - I had watched someone play the demo and loved the art style, so I've been looking forward to the release. Unfortunately, the visuals seem to be the only worthwhile thing about this game.

[b]+ visuals[/b]: the locations are 360-degree photographs with additional art over it. It's pretty good if a location is interesting, e.g. an occult bookshop full of trinkets or an underground arthouse bar - otherwise it's rather boring (random streets, a parking lot, some bland buildings).
The best thing in the whole game is the art style of avatars which we see during dialogues - they bear a hint of madness. I also like the idea of posters that introduce every new segment of the game. Too bad you can't take time to inspect them, because after a few seconds the game takes you to the next screen.

 [b]- sound and voice acting[/b]: the music is okay - not annoying, not great, mostly monotonous and kind of sluggish. The English voice acting is just bad: weird intonations, audible slips and most jarring - all actors pronounce proper nouns in their own ""unique"" way (Idh-yaa -> Idaho, idea, eehd-ya). Once it gets as far as Cthulhu with a ""z"". Also, voice lines are a bit different from subtitles most of the time.

 [b]- puzzles[/b]: there's maybe 3 puzzles that qualify as puzzles in the whole game. Otherwise, it's ""find a tiny light switch on a 360-photo"" or just click on things. The whole game is basically searching for interactables on photos. There is a lot of going back and forth, especially due to how disorienting some locations may be. The only thing that helps is that the way you came from is always behind your back.

 [b]- story[/b]: the story is served in small fragments, with 3 characters that change from fragment to fragment. Though, it does not make any difference - they don't have any special abilities or anything, they just go to different locations. Could as well be just one character.
There is little to no introduction of people and events (posters help a bit), even timeline is not 100% clear. Admittedly, there is a prologue to this game that I have not played. Does this game rely on the prologue to explain everything? On second thoughts, there is nothing to explain, because nothing really happens.

 [b]- controls[/b]: if you're on keyboard and mouse, then you can throw your keyboard away, since not a single key is used. Even Esc is not working, so you will have to drag your cursor to close inventory and main menu each time. It may sound like a very minor thing, but it gets very annoying. Besides, there is no way to change mouse sensitivity in the settings. No bindings whatsoever.

There is only one save, and it's overwritten every time you move to a new location, so basically every 5-10 seconds. So if you'd like to go back for any reason, you'll have to make your own back-ups.

Finally, the credits are unskippable and are followed by a weird video which makes no sense.",0,1712358566,344,0,21
5737,1474900,"I ended up not even finishing the game and refunding.
The game is pretty much interacting with photos but you spend ages hovering your mouse everywhere to find some things. 
Not much story that you lose interest unless you're into reading so many notes that just give you little bits of lovecraftian lore.
But what pushed me to completely give up is the bad navigation on the game. You click to go next area but not 100% sure where you just came from. You end up clicking and going back the same place because there's nothing telling you the locations of the area your about to go to before you click.
I didn't even get to any puzzles in a hour of playing... unless the dev means puzzles of clicking around the locations randomly until you find a key for a door.... that's kinda lame..",0,1712410232,53,0,24
5738,1474900,"The 3D scenes in this game are great, but that is all that is really going for it. This does have some issues, as in the lighthouse there is clearly a painting of Jesus, however when you move into the room with it, it is suddenly different.

Moving around the game is horrendous, as you have to remember the layout of some of the areas, even when they dont visually connect to the same place. This means you get lost easily. In one area, walking into an elevator leads into a break room? Some kind of map, or use of better locations would have helped massively. Some parts of the game do have you following sounds to get through the areas, which seems to be only a way to cover the issue of confusing layout.

The voice acting is extremely hit or miss, especially when characters were meant to be scared. 

The character models in this game are horrifying, not in the lovecraft way, just horrifyingly bad. They are so jarrying to see along with the real world environments.

You can find most things, however there are sometimes 1 or 2 things that are near impossible to spot.

It would be nice to have a way to select the chapters in the main menu once you have completed the game, or at least have save slots.

The game also lacks a mouse sensitivity option, which sucks as it is controlled only with the mouse.",0,1712779374,219,0,58
5739,1474900,"I recommended the game on the following criteria:

1. I liked the art style. I felt it was unique and really enjoyed seeing all of the scenes.
2. I am a huge fan of Lovecraftian horror and felt this fit in pretty well for the Mythos.
3. The little Easter eggs of lore that many people wouldn't get unless they play games, watch shows, or read books about the Mythos were really fun. 

What was bad about the game? 

1. The voice acting. Not all of it was bad, but a good portion of the game was CRINGE-worthy as far as the acting goes. The actors should've learned the lines instead of reading them obviously off a script. And some of the subtitles were really wrong compared to what the actors say. 

2. The weird character models. I think those were the creepiest and weirdest parts of the games. Instead of using whatever program that was used...they should've hired some graphics people to make the character models look better.

3. There weren't any real puzzles to speak of, in my opinion. It's more akin to a walking sim/graphic novel than a puzzle game. Sure, there's a few point and click items, but it's never really in-depth puzzle solving. 

4. I don't want to replay the game in order to get the final achievements and you can't easily get all of them in one playthrough. I can't imagine playing this again, honestly. It was fine for the first time, but I just can't sit through all of that again for a few achievements you can't easily get. 

Positives: Lovecraftian cosmic horror, fun artistic style (aside from character models of people you interact with). No real jump scares (in my opinion). Spooky, but not terrifying. No fighting. Pretty easy to play in one sitting (not super long). Not overly expensive.",1,1712970049,250,0,46
5740,1474900,"Definitely do not recommend this. It's so bad - I regret sticking through it and not returning it. I have no idea if the Spanish voice acting is better but GOOD LORD the English voice acting is absolutely horrendous, the game is janky, and it's poorly written.

Pros: 
- The areas looked cool - like photos taken from reality.

Cons:
- Atrocious English voice-acting. Voice actors should be acting, not just reading lines. Several characters would even pronounce the same words differently.
- The gameplay was awful. I love point and click adventure games - even horror first person ones (Scratches, anyone?) but this was more ""hidden object"" - you basically just looked around every area until you found things to click. There was maybe 2-3 puzzles?
- The areas were confusing - and moving from one area to another sometimes made no sense.
- The jankiness of the game when it segued into cutscenes was extra bad.
- The story - the game was just full of references to Lovecraft's fiction and other horror - but sometimes I felt like they put more effort into that then telling a good story. 
",0,1712524155,241,0,22
5741,1474900,"Extremely overpriced and honestly just not good.

What a shame; this is yet another terrible Lovecraftian title. So bad, in fact, I have no clue where to even start.

The game has zero quality of life. I spent the large quantity of this one baffled by what to do. The game doesn't give you any hints as to what to look for, leading to confusion. The only way to learn what to do is to read mountains of text or re-listen to some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard, which I'll touch on more in my second point. (this could have been fixed with adding a simple journal telling you what to do next)

I'm all for seeing indie titles use voice actors, but the voice acting here was genuinely awful. It sounds so forced and cringe-worthy that I ended up giving up.

The main gimmick here is the game uses real-life locations, so you can spin in a 360 motion to look for clues, which is pretty cool. But this comes at a major cost because it's using this, you can't really notice what looks out of place, which is usually how you find collectibles or clues and such. A lot of my time spent was just spam clicking everything, hoping I would eventually solve the 'puzzle.'

Personally, just to my taste, I really don't understand the art direction. You start off as a supposed human sacrifice for some secret cult, which makes sense for a good disturbing opening. Then it cuts to this Marvel/DC-esque style, which to me makes absolutely no sense. It's just bizarre. I know Lovecraft is known for the weird, but this is just weird in a bad way. (Kinda like when Jared Leto was cast as Joker and had a bunch of ugly tattoos bad)

Overall, and I'm sorry devs, but truthfully, this game is hideous. I'm struggling to see what makes this game worth £12, and unfortunately, this seems to be yet another Lovecraft game hit with Cthulhu's curse, as I really didn't like anything about this game.",0,1713047788,53,0,239

Another totally obscene addition by Cherry Kiss Games. Want to violate an innocent virgin angel, and make her your personal sex slave? Go ahead and buy this game. 

Otherwise don't. Other then the fetishes they present, there really isn't much to this game. Story is mediocre, it only serves to introduce you to the sex scenes. Gamaplay is non-existant, no options, no mini-games, just click and read. 
Pro Tip: If you don't care about the story and just want to watch the hentai scenes, enable skip unseen text in options and then just skip the entire game, takes less then a minute, and you have all the hentai scenes under ""Extras"".

Even in their other games where the MC uses similar means to gain what he wants, at least with their other games the MC wasn't the initial aggressor or was in some way wronged by those targeted. Here the girl is simply an annoyance to him, that he very easily could've gotten rid of. Sadly, despite the high quality of the CGs the angles they're set in are so poor that the game isn't even redeemed to any degree by the H - CK has many other games with better characters, story, and CG angles for the same price (many of which I've reviewed as well).

5759,1474200,"A timed Sudoku game with a monster fighting UI. 

During combat (Sudoku puzzle) the time slot slowly goes down, when it hits 0 the monster will attack. The regular attack only decreases health and for special attacks, it can be a debuff like rocks blocking numbers, clear several numbers player previously filled etc. For every right number player fills it refills the time and when all numbers are correctly filled it's a win.

This game feels relaxing because (1) player can buy items to autofill numbers, and (2) Wrong numbers cannot be filled so it automatically lowers the difficulty. BTW, this is not a RPG game because there is no level up, no weapon nor attacking moves. The coins rewarded by defeating monsters are mostly used for health upgrades.

I recommend it to whoever likes sudoku or wants to learn it.

[b]Elrit Clover -A forest in the rut is full of dangers-[/b] is a lewd platformer about a girl on the run from her rapey captors.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Dodge boulders and solve puzzles through trial and error. The goal of the game is to reach the end of each stage (and avoid capture or pitfalls!) However, to unlock each lewd scene you're encouraged to lose to select enemies. Thankfully, it's easy to backtrack to the correct areas using the ""select stage"" screen. Most of the ""puzzles"" involve moving boxes or evading oncoming projectiles. Some stages include [i]action-platforming[/i] and others stealth. You'll likely die (a lot), but there is virtually no penalty to death. . . unless you die following a cutscene. There's no ""skip"" button! 

[h1]Story[/h1]
Ellie is on her way to the Prime Minister. However, she is no visitor; she rides beside her sister, Fortuna, [i]in chains.[/i] The Prime Minister has a special appreciation for virgins. Watching them writhe in pain is how he [i]gets his rocks off.[/i] Fortuna doesn't want her sister to be a sex slave -- so she helps her escape, and sends her into the Ilrit forest. Ellie must find the Imperial Garrison to break her chains. However, women, [i]especially virgins,[/i] are a hot commodity, no matter where they go! She'll have to to dodge animals in heat and sneak past rapey bandits. Not even the [i]dead[/i] will pass her up!

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen is a total mess. The overall English leaves something to be desired. From ""option"", you may adjust audio, display and language preferences. The player character can be altered via ""customize character"". From the character customization screen, you may choose between breast sizes, color presets and outfits. This is one of those games that worked my GPU to the bone -- be sure to employ a frame limiter if you decide to purchase this game.

[b]- The Goods -[/b]
There are ten animated, somewhat interactive sex-scenes to unlock. In each scene, the main protagonist is raped by one or more people or monsters. Each scene includes multiple animations featuring new positions or climaxes. Bodily fluids are animated ([b]poorly[/b]). The models are [i]acceptable[/i]; however, they seldom mesh together. This is a symptom of using a variety of (typically premade) assets made by differing artists. I enjoyed the animations, if it's [b]plain as day[/b] the protagonist experiences emotional and physical trauma as animated tears roll off her face.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Wait for a strong sale and a visual updates. The gameplay is casual and the controls are snappy; but it's repetitive and the ""puzzles"" are shallow. Mosaics and visual errors ruin otherwise [i]decent[/i] adult animations. As much as I enjoy money shots, the distorted cream-pies are unacceptable. [b]Elrit Clover[/b] is a rough platformer that could have better -- [i]much better.[/i] Though [b]Elrit Clover[/b] isn't a bad game, for seventeen USD it's blatant rip off. It plays like a flash game with with memeware graphics. If you're okay with pixelated genitalia, I'd consider this game during an eighty or [i]ninety-percent-off[/i] sale.

5781,1473630,"Nope, not worth its price, even with 30% off.

It's beyond janky, and not even of the good kind that could have made it somewhat adorable :

- it's yet another of these Unity assets flip, where everything is approximately cobbled together but we can definitely see the lack of consistency through and through. It becomes a glaring issue as soon as you reach the abandoned mines

- the translation is below a high-school level, even a MTL would have produced better and more sensible results

- none of the cutscenes can be skipped which means losing is fairly quickly infuriating early on

- vines and platforms are attached to nothing, they float in the air, in plain sight. Some crates required for certain puzzles also float into the air without any logic. There are traps at a certain point that you must avoid, which don't have any texture nor even an item. They're just a gigantic purple square and the trigger plate is white, sticking out like a sore thumb

- the swinging mechanic on the red vines is absolutely pointless because there's zero momentum when you launch the protagonist into the air

- graphics are beyond buggy, especially when liquids are involved, breaking into over-stretched polygons all over the screen

- the escape sequence will drive you insane, because you would logically think that you're supposed to run away from your pursuer but if you do that you'll instantly connect every single time with the oversized hitbox of the tiny rocks in your path, thus failing and being forced to watch the cutscene over and over again

- the infiltration sequence is equally bad, because nothing tells you when you're hidden or not, or when you're supposed to crouch and crawl to remain out of the enemies' sight. It even has a Metal Gear Solid moment, when you wear a crate as a disguise... which completely breaks the infiltration because enemies no longer see you as long as you remain crouched while moving forward

Value your time. Value your money. But most importantly, value yourself. Do not purchase that product under any circumstances.",0,1656150088,33,0,17
5782,1473630,"If your thinking about buying this then wait until it heavenly discounted because 15$ is not worth it. 

The character creation is lacking. There is only one Hair Style and very few cloths to select from. 

Having Anime girl characters being mix in with Elder Scroll like characters pretty much break the immersion and it make it hard to take the game seriously because it feels like a asset flip game which wouldn't surprise if this is one.

Story makes no sense. Something happens while your in your carriage then they just throw you into the game play.

Speaking of game play. The Game is so short and easy you will be able to beat this game in 40 minutes. Which is the main reason why 15$ is too much for such a short game.

The few positive I can give this game for is that there is a few different game play styles like Platforming, Stealth like Metal Gear Style like game and run away from the monster while being in a dark cave while scaring them away with your torch.

Controls is very basic and easy to understand on the keyboard but using a Xbox Control is absolutely not recommend. Who ever translated this game doesn't know the buttons on the X Box Controller.   X is not a Running Button but the Left Trigger is and Right Bumper is not a grab button but The Right Trigger Button is. I  Also would like to add is that every time when you do use the grab the button on the controller the game it pause for a second.

Now the worst part about using a Xbox controller is for whatever odd reason they made the right analog stick moves the mouse around. I don't know why that is their but it has cause me to accidentally open up programs  on my task bar and I would accidentally move my game window a bit.

So in other words use the Key Board.



So all and all. I don't recommend this game because It absolutely needs work and need to be updated more. Save your money.

5784,1473630,"A very basic platformer with average gameplay, inadequate asset usage and the lack of sound effects for platforming actions.

However, the H-scenes are very well-made, fully voiced and animated, although the background visibility toggle option doesn't work on all scenes and it'd be better to have the option to adjust the lighting in the gallery H-scenes. At the same time, besides the already well-made game over H-scenes, it'd be interesting to have more H-scenes, be it in-stage H-scenes when colliding with enemies, or victory H-scenes after clearing all stages.

As for the customization, I'd like to have the option to remove the chain handcuff as well as having more hairstyles,

5786,1473640,"This game looks cool. I'm not ruling it out yet. That said, I am experiencing a few issues:

- While I can lock onto targets, I don't seem to be able to shoot. I have weapons equipped, but nothing I do triggers them to shoot. Reading the controls page, it seems like I should be able to lock on target, press the number the weapon is assigned, and left click to shoot. But that is not working so I'm just a fish in a barrel :)

- While this game is not marked as a VR game, steam VR tries to open everytime I open the game and that's super annoying.

- I have no idea what any of the items do. There doesn't seem to be a description.

5787,1473650,"Combat is awkward. You are bound to a grid, but the grid isn't clearly visible, you can move diagonally, but only enemies can attack diagonally.

Movement is very slow, and backtracking is required. Also your goal is never clear, so you will be constantly wandering around aimlessly at a slow speed.

There are many branching paths, but no map. So you better have a good memory, but it's kind of hard to memorize a very generic world that all kind of blends together and looks the same.

There is a bug where sometimes chests just cant be opened for no apparent reason. I confirmed this was a bug because after starting a fresh save file, previously unopenable chests suddenly worked, and some other chests that opened before could no longer be interacted with. I can't say for sure, but I think this resulted in softlocking my game because there was a big chest that i couldn't interact with, the game is so unclear though it's hard to say for sure if this is just some weird intended mechanic.

There are a 3 seemingly pointless mechanics? 
-You have a stamina bar, but it didn't seem to affect anything or matter when it ran out.
-You collect orb things that cap at 3 and then go away after a short time at the top right of the screen, again no idea what they did if anything.
-There is a ""hit"" counter like in some fighting games, but again it doesn't seem to matter or have any interaction with the game in anyway.

5794,1473760,"It's Tyrian, with a few changes.

You now need to manage your ship's power, more so than the original Tyrian. Your generator can be split into multiple power cells, effectively being able to spread power more evenly between your ship's systems. While this might not be for everyone, I personally welcome the change, allowing for more creativity and customisation when going for a particular build (movement, tank, dps, etc.)

Another change regarding power, your power cells can be damaged in combat, meaning you may need to re-route power on the ""fly"" (hilarious i know) to compensate for damaged cells. Time is slowed while you do this, making it not as difficult as it sounds. Again, might not be for everyone, but i think it's awesome. Makes me feel like i'm a cool space ship pilot man

The music is great. 10/10. Music really captures the old school Tyrian vibe. Even the jukebox is included, as seen in the original.

Sadly, no multiplayer. I personally spent a lot of time playing the multiplayer in the original with friends and family, and would love to see this added to the game at some point, if it's possible.

If you played and loved Tyrian back in the day, you will feel right at home playing this. Well worth the money in my opinion",1,1664860267,664,0,2

5796,1473760,"As someone who LOVES Tyrian/2000, this needs some work, but the bones are here for an excellent Tyrian remake/re-imagining.


Firstly and most noticeable - the new energy system takes quite a bit to adapt to and I can see some fans HATING it, but it brings a new wrinkle to the ship systems I loved in Tyrian. You will definitely have a few test runs where you end up stalled out, no energy, taking hits until you are destroyed for lack of shields/hull/movement. Swap some parts, reroute your energy, try again! That's a huge part of the enjoyment for me - the ship customisation options. Some power routing setups will simply not work but you wont know for sure until you try it.

The weapons are definitely inspired by Tyrian as well, but have all(so far) been different enough to warrant testing out weapons you never would have tried before. Different weapons help different builds, and the variety of combinations is massive.

The enemies- oh my. Many ""classic"" enemies are familiar and dealt with in short order. The new enemies however vary in difficulty from bugs hitting the windshield all the way up to to basically instant death to a starter ship. Some groups and areas appear unbeatable at first as the enemy combinations and volume seem absolutely overwhelming. Wander off, rebuild your ship, and try again when you want to. Again, rebuilding your ship and trying new weapons can make all the difference.

The new open map style is nice right now, using energy cells to traverse the grid and grinding up more cells once you reach your destination to make your next jump to leave. Time will tell if it becomes too grind-ey.


In short: Fans of Tyrian/2000 will absolutely see some glimmers of what they liked in the other games in this one, whether or not the new changes are better will be a matter of opinion but it is worth a shot right now, even more so if the creator continues to update, balance, and tweak.

Liking what I have seen so far, has awesome potential.",1,1664922761,271,0,46
5797,1473760,"I came here because I loved Tyrian. While the game is very similar, The progression is not linear and way to hard at the beginning.

5798,1473760,"I cannot recommend this game yet - it feels like an Early Access game rather than a full release. That said, I am hopeful that further updates will polish this to a point where I can happily recommend it.

If you found this game, you are probably a fan of Tyrian. I'm not a fan of the shoot em up genre, but Tyrian is different, and I was really happy for another game that follows in its footsteps. At the moment however, it has several issues, both as a Tyrian successor, and from a general gameplay perspective:

[*] It's too easy to die. In Tyrian, your shield acts as a buffer to hits, and armor is where you're punished if you don't dodge enough ships, objects, or attacks. The problem here is your shield not only charges up very slowly, some attacks and enemies will deplete your shield and armor almost instantaneously, and it doesn't feel fair.

[*] The power cell system, while an interesting concept, needs revising. Unlike Tyrian where you could pop on a powerful generator and it took care of everything, you need to allocate different systems to different cells here. If you go with the default setup, you will get wiped fast. My biggest gripe about this is the shield recharge. Your shield will NOT recharge, or do it much slower unless you allocate it to power cells that ideally, only have your movement tied to it. I tried allocating shield recharge to 4 vs 8 cells, and the 4 cell charged while the 8 cell stalled, because in the latter, it was also tied to the front weapon. In other words, 4 cells exclusive to shields will charge faster than 4 cells exclusive to shields + 4 extra also tied to the front weapon... that doesn't make sense to me!

[*] The game advertises ""Lots of ships, enemies and weapons"", but so far I've seen a dearth in variety. I've hopped around a bunch of different locations on the map, and haven't seen any more than four different ships. There's a dearth in weapon variety, I've gone to locations in far corners, and see nothing but the same cheap starter weapons. Generators and shields are also lacking, and it's a real disappointment to travel across the galaxy to find there's nothing new to offer for your troubles. The same goes for enemies... I feel like I've seen most of the types the game has to offer already. EDIT: Per the developer response, yellow datacubes need to be found to unlock things. So it sounds like tackling new locations for the cubes will be the way to find them.

[*] Warp cells are another interesting concept, but feels like artificial impediment of progression and travel, as you are limited to holding 9 cells at a time, which seems like a ridiculous limit given each square of the map requires a cell, so you'll be using these up fast. I understand that limiting travel to 9 cells at a time may have been the intent, but why not let us hold unlimited warp cells, and just restrict the distance we can travel at once to 9? I don't want to be stuck in an empty space square, farming cells to get to my next destination.

[*] Another issue related to the above is the ridiculous difficulty you'll come across while traveling sometimes. There are certain areas where you'll be bombarded with massive numbers of enemies and attacks, and with the lack of weapon variety and punch even when they're maxed out, you won't stand a chance unless you're some sort of bullet hell expert. In fact, the risk of coming across these impossible fleets means you are punished if you attempt to travel on the map more than one square at a time. It's really unfun trying to go 9 cells at once, and then halfway through the difficulty spikes and you give up and go one at a time instead.

[*] The presentation also feels amateurish. If you've played Tyrian, you'll recognize some of the graphics from the game, touched up for the higher resolution, and I don't mind that. But the background blends in and isn't aesthetically pleasing, sometimes it feels like someone went a bit too hog wild with Photoshop, rather than developing a distinct style. The writing in the datacubes feels the same way. Datacubes in Tyrian had personality whether it was the characters or funny little ads. Here everything just feels... samey. I'm not sure how to elaborate without going on at length other than it doesn't feel like there are different voices. I'd love to see the art and writing get more polish once the gameplay deficits are out of the way.

If you are a Tyrian fan, don't let all of this put you off the game just yet, but for now, I'd suggest keeping watch for further updates so the experience is enjoyable, rather than playing and hoping you get to the point where it gets fun. If/when things get patched and updated, I'll update this review because I'd hate to deter proliferation of more Tyrian-like games. For now however, I'd suggest holding off if you're looking to get your Tyrian itch scratched. This is definitely more early access/beta than a complete game.",0,1665264088,294,0,3
5799,1473760,"Beyond the Storm is certainly a love leter to Tyrian, right down to the silly and wacky contents of the datacubes! And yet Beyond the Storm does its own thing by adding an open space system to choose your battles, as well as creating a more customizable power management system (which can be adjusted mid-battle!) and the twiddles have been regulated to a far more intuitive system.

Beyond the Storm is worth playing, especially for the low price it's sold at. For gamers who want to try a fun indie game, Beyond the Storm is a great investment. For die-hard Tyrian fans this game is a must!",1,1674116878,522,0,5
5800,1473760,"Mom, can we have Tyrian?

No, we have Tyrian at home

Tyrian at home be like.....

-----------------------------------------

This game is doing itself a disservice by associating with a timeless classic like Tyrian. Comparing yourself to a well made arcade game when this game is still in a 0.8 version torpedoes it further.

This game is so unpolished, it feels jagged. It's like trying to reverse engineer a title you loved by just remembering how it was. Hell, some textures I believe were used straight from the game. But everything is off.

There is so much to talk about here, and I can't really be bothered to go through it all, so I'll just mention the main bullet points:
- Movement is super jerky and sudden. The background parallax moves so violently I was getting dizzy, which no game has ever manager.
- The power management system is a nice idea, but ultimately poorly explained and implemented. Movement takes engine power, and some weapons don't have a cap on how much energy they will eat up (bug of the rear vulcan?)
- Levels don't have a flow. They are nonsensically thrown together to look like Tyrian, but whereas the original had almost a harmony and spectacle to it's deployment of enemies, here it's haphazard and random, compounded by jerky and sudden movements.
- Menus are straight up not fun to navigate. Your mouse has to travel all over the place to buy, replace and change things. Everything is mouse-over and you can accidentally change stuff you didn't intend.
- Money is sparse. Tyrian rewarded you for destroying things, and you bought stuff for your score. Here, only a few enemy types drop currency of any kind.
- Every kind of animation or movement needs ease-in and ease-out. I can't stress enough how bad this makes the game feel - the enemies just zoom instead of ""flying"", they don't feel like they have inertia.
- Bakcground oftentimes covers your vision. There was a lot of times the enemies were obscured by platforms or clouds and attacked you with their huge projectiles from there.


TL;DR - if you try to copy a formula, you need to understand what makes it work in the first place. The dev put a lot of focus in places that Tyrian only skimmed over (power generation/distribution), while neglecting the essential parts (sound design, enemy patterns and spectacle)",0,1667826754,29,0,79
5801,1473760,"Really great game! Tyrian was one of my favourite games when I was younger and this game is a worthy attempt to modernise it.

5802,1473760,"Yes, yes, yes. This game is Tyrian 2022. I randomly stumbled upon this and was really in shock to see it. 

Anyone complaining that it isn't identical to Tyrian 1995 can go download DOS box and go play the 1995 version. The game is no longer linear game play (awesome) and there is more complexity to your ship (great). Its supposed to be a challenge and these little tweaks really add to the game play value. Its still an awesome arcade style classic with a more modern play experience.

The only con is no multiplayer. If they even add local multiplayer support, like the original game, (one person uses mouse, one person uses keyboard) it would be freaking awesome! But then if they could manage to add remote play it would be perfect!

100/100 recommended if you like any old school shooter arcade style game like this. If you can't handle the graphics please just GTFO.",1,1680075411,914,0,5
5803,1473760,"Beyond the storm is a take on Tyrian, developed by one guy, which in itself is quite impressive.    Much of what made Tyrian (and other games like it) great is here.  The balancing act of which weapons, generators and shields should be used remains intact from the game it's copying.    Unfortunately ""copying"" is the term, this isn't enough 'inspired' by Tyrian, it's definitely 'what if Tyrian but...':  Lots of the art and weapon names are clearly taken straight from Tyrian, while the rest is jarringly the work of a much more novice artist (though some look better than others).   

That theme continues into the gameplay - most of the new ideas are conceptually quite good, but fall flat: The new power juggling dynamic is basically pointless, once you fine tune the front firing guns to have enough juice (by default the game only allocates half your generator towards them, and resets whenever you upgrade the generator); The open world idea breaks up the linear flow of Tyrian to its detriment, forcing you to grind levels to have enough fuel to move to the next area;  That's exacerbated by what seems to be a semi-procedural aspect - while enemies might be the same in replaying the same mission, the levels do (not always but sometimes) vary slightly; The sheer number of required levels (which is probably what is driving that procedural generation?) also means that some are outrageously short (30 seconds at most), while a couple were comically long (like 5 minutes, with the last minute being almost completely silent flying with no enemies).

Most importantly though, the open world forces three critical weaknesses.   Firstly the game now NEEDS a clear story, with missions being scattered around the map, you have to have a method to pick the next place to go, and the writing (and presentation of story via dropped data-cubes) doesn't support this.    Secondly, the need to travel means fuel, and that fuel (along with the data cubes that drive the story) is randomly dropped during missions, you might get 0, or you might get 7, but often you'll get just one.   Since the world map routinely has you moving 9 spaces to the next mission, that means grinding the one available mission at the current location 9 times (if you try and go half way then you might get lucky and find some fuel as you go, but more likely you'll have to pay to go back to where you were when you run out of fuel).   Worst of all, I ended up seemingly soft locked in what I think was the story campaign as no datacubes would drop when i reached my destination.
Finally, and most critically, the fact that you can go anywhere means that either certain areas are impossible to defeat, or that all areas are at a base difficulty level.  I couldn't be sure which it was, but my sense is that nowhere is really hard, but some places are hard by the standards of a player just starting out.

Overall the result is, as others have said, a mixed bag.   The Tyrian gameplay is here, but it's hidden behind some design decisions that obstruct and obscure the core of the game.  Mechanically the ships work fine, but once you move to faster ships, the movement becomes too fast to get fine control (unlike the original, ship's don't accelerate up to their fastest lateral speed), which is criticised by some below.   It's not awful due to the relative ease of the game, but it does mean that delicate flying around fixed objects can sometimes mean an instant death.

While I think there's potential for a game to recommend here, it's hard to be certain that the game is definitely going to get there.   For me, I think I'll come back to this in a year and give the developer time to tidy some bits up.  There is the core of a good game here and, for a one-man show, the product so far is pretty impressive; but the game would seriously benefit from a professional artist reviewing the new art-set (and being ruthless), dedicated translations (some of the 'database entries' are outright incomprehensible), perhaps a punchier synth mix for the soundtrack and a tighter view on the gameplay.",1,1677448156,257,0,44
5804,1473760,"It gets the vibe of Tyrian right, but the ""open world"" levels/stages doesn't work very well. It's hard to keep track of where you've been and what you've completed, and it ends up feeling like you're just playing random levels. The parallax also tends to be irritating or distracting in a way Tyrian never did.

I feel this game is promising, but needs a little cohesion before it becomes a serious homage to Tyrian. Cautiously recommending it BUT I really advise Tyrian fans to give it more time.",1,1677436348,52,0,26
5805,1473760,"I was very sceptical when I first learned of this project. [i]Tyrian[/i] (1995, DOS) set a high standard for its time, and remains beautiful and enjoyable to play even three decades later. So I wasn't optimistic about anyone doing it justice with a revival or successor.

I'm happy to report that I was wrong. [i]Beyond the Storm[/i] is an enjoyable tribute. The art and music are instantly recognisable as updated takes on the original; there's a similar sense of humour in its writing; and of course, there is the same modular spaceship equipment system that gave [i]Tyrian[/i] its depth and replayability.

Not content to merely recreate the old game, [i]Beyond the Storm[/i] adds a power management mechanic (with an in-flight slow-motion if you make adjustments on the fly), a grid-based space map which the player can traverse non-linearly (by spending warp fuel cells), and the ability to select from and repeat levels (Sectors).

[b]Power management:[/b] Power from the ship's generator can be distributed across an adjustable number of cells, and the ship's subsystems can be assigned to draw from specific cells. While you can (usually) put together a good ship just by buying the most expensive components in each category, you can make it even better by tweaking the power distribution.

[b]Space map:[/b] A map populated by various planets, asteroid zones, space stations, and the like can be navigated at will, as long as you have the necessary amount of fuel. The game is much more open-ended than [i]Tyrian[/i] as you can collect messages containing requests or clues, and choose whether to follow up on them by travelling to the appropriate location.

[b]Selectable levels:[/b] Each zone has one or more Sectors (playable levels) associated with it. Unlike [i]Tyrian[/i], which was largely linear and where most levels could only be visited once within a playthrough, here you can select the same ones repeatedly if you like, or play the available ones in any order.

I do have a few complaints about this game, although they are relatively minor and may not hinder some players at all:

- The space map is not easily scrollable. To look around past the current area, you have to click on distant tiles to move the view. This would really benefit from basic click-and-drag movement and/or scrollbars.

- The screen that lists the selectable Sectors gives no descriptions for them, and also does not show any indication of which ones have already been visited/completed.

- Although the writing is amusing enough, the English text is still riddled with language errors and could benefit from more proofreading.

Despite its imperfections, there's a lot to appreciate and enjoy in this game.

I will not refund it, because someone accomplished his goal and made a game, he deserves something for that.

Ok so, it would be wrong to offer nothing but criticism, thus ill start with the good.

Good stuff: Behind the clumsy interface, there is a potential depth of gameplay here. The idea of alternating between heroes and towers is not bad, and crafting crystals mid fight as well as non-tower structures (gathering, fusing) could have some weight in forging a deep strategy later on.
Oh also... NO BUGs! (so far).

THAT BEING SAID...so...the bad...I should have made a list before writing this. (keep in mind, this is to help, so, with all the love in the world, please don't hate me X_X)

1) The whole game feels like a really early access here is the list as to why:
- Missing SFX on most actions, it would be shorter to list the things that produce sounds. (Hero mode has more sfx).
- Missing music in most menu and in game.
- Missing clear instructions in tutorial.
- Menus, UI, main screen, all feel incomplete, there is no personality to any of it.
- The assets aren't too bad, but I'm not convinced they aren't straight out of something else.

2) The game is actually very hard to play to unplayable for me:
- There is no slider for scrolling speed (or cursor speed), thus i cant use the keyboard to scroll/move around the map, it goes around faster than the flash with diarrhea. You can use the mouse, but that's hit and miss.
- There is no framerate limit, or options to limit them (v-sync), I got scared I may blow my GPU when it did not stop going full spin when the game ended, i had to launch something else to calm it down.
- No options to rebind keys, which is a shame because you have buttons to open various menus, switch between character and tower mode, etc.

3) Gameplay is very barebone and needs serious improvement
- The concept of tower + hero is not gracefully executed and doesn't accomplish much to stand out with either/both, aided and made worse by the depth of elemental options.
- There is no hero customisation or even knowledge of what is actually what. How much damage will my attack do? is there an element? whats my reach?. Missing statistics, maybe the possibility to change, looks, weapons, etc?
- The hero combat feels lackluster, you do not feel the impacts, the enemies are not hindered by them, the only way to know you hit them is if their HP lowers after you pressed the button.
- All of the hero attacks feels the same and the mouse is not bound to some attack by default, switching control scheme is not that big of a deal, but this is not top down, you use your mouse to aim in 3d anyways.
- Towers are kind of fine, they take a while to build, but that can be understandable, but the game puts them on a secondary role with the hero being the main thing, since you cant just build them upfront. You have to make syntetizers to make crystals to make towers and other things (golems).
- The way the game switch between both modes (build-hero control) is unusual. In similar game you either get build phases, mid gameplay build while in hero mode, or even pause to build. Here its all nonstop, with the downside of having additional manipulations and activities to track and enable, such as making crystals. It does not make it unplayable, but it feels like it hinders both mode. Maybe a small slowdown when switching to build mode would help?
- Only 9 levels, no achievement, no cards, no customisation available. Most Tower Defence on the markets offer more value at the same price. Unless you get Golem TD on sale...and even then, I am pretty confident many free ones may attract you more.

What else, I'm under 10 mins of gameplay time, will edit when I get 2 more minutes in :) (done, edit added)

5831,1473870,"Fun game. Basic silly fun, a genre I call Trap Defense as opposed to Tower Defense, but enjoyable.
Sadly the game does end out of nowhere, not sure why, but not all of my trap slots ever got full. Did I fail in some way? It doesn't say.
Game play is basic, souls drop in at the top, and race to the bottom, and the players perspective is from the side. You get one kind of trap at the start, and gain more types as things progress. You do have to be careful though, because they come with traits that can be positive or negative, and I suspect bad choices could really work against you. 
Traps can be leveled up, as well, which is good because the number of traps you can lay is limited.
The screams and the blood as cartoonish, nothing unsettling or disturbing, though perhaps not for young children. 
A story would be nice, and certainly there could easily be a lot more to it, but for what it is, on sale, it has been an enjoyable romp. About an hour in, and not bored with it yet.",1,1614515268,111,0,552

There are no waves so all the enemies are just thrown at you and you have no time to think and even if you complete a level it doesn´t feel good.

The humans spawn in very large numbers, and the traps you get only kill one human each and take like 5 seconds (the can be upgraded to be faster) to reset, meaning the difference is you clicking on them.  Each level is consists of branching paths, and you have no real way of controlling the flow of the enemies.  You start out with just bear traps, and get new ones, as well as perks (which can give positive or negative bonuses) every other level it seems.  The other traps I did see in my brief time with this game also only seemed to be able to kill one target at a time, so the clickfest never gets better.

I beat it in about 30-40 minutes, the rest of my time was spent in the sandbox trying to figure out how to beat it quicker (sandbox has a leaderboard), however, I was only able to beat it in 74-76 seconds. not sure how I am supposed to beat it any faster when the people spawn in only so fast.

for 3 dollars its okay, but I didn't find it very fun just due to the repetitiveness of it. for the first few levels its great, then its ok, then its meh. each level is the same pretty much in that you click, place down 1 or 2 types of traps, and wait. some of the levels are pretty crazy though, but only because they have multiple spawners/level exits though.

A couple of Quality of Life improvements could help this game out a lot:
- No achievement for 100%-ing a level is a bummer.
- More human variations and not just ginger women (do gingers even have souls?) and brown haired shirt-man.
- The tutorial did not communicated it well what's the fail state of the game (or I just didn't payed enough attention.) Something like an orange colored kill percentage at the end would be awesome if I reach a low score (e.g. 40%)

Really short reviews of this game since there's not much to say because it's R18 or nothing.

A story made just to fill the game as a Visual Novel but in reality it has no real meaning. This game is very good especially the CGs and the character of Seina who is really beautiful.
I'm not sure if there is a lot of BGM but despite that, listening to the same music for 5 hours didn't bother me.
This game should be purchased during the discount only if you want to see the R18 scene. If you want to enjoy a complex story, don't buy it.

The story incorporates theology/philosophy, though H content is by far the main focus, keeping the plot from being interesting or reaching its potential. Seina is cute and a nice character, but I found the MC insufferable. I think they could have wrote a memorable story with their concept (without hindering the H), instead of the dull forgettable one they delivered.

My favourite quote from the novel is ""If a God who doesn't listen to prayer is no God, then that would mean humans decide what God is. That can't be. After all, it was God who decided what humans were. The creator is God Himself. Humans are not the creators of God."" - Seina.

If you're a fan of roguelikes, time and resource management and space, you'll love this game. Randomized encounters and environmental effects like pirates, asteroids and solar flares mean you have to decide where best to allocate your limited power, sometimes on the fly. There's three difficulty settings and the ""easy"" setting is incredibly forgiving for those struggling. I spent at least three continues after getting pulverized by a fleet battle! The devs are constantly working on improving the game as well as adding more things like character backstories. The game is as challenging as you want it to be.

It doesn't try to be more than what it is, which is a relatively short but very entertaining shooter.  I love shooters but suck badly at them, and I found this relatively forgiving.  It can get bullet hellish in the later going, but not so much where it gets frustrating.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this, especially at its absurdly low price point.  My only criticism is that the achievement system appears to be somewhat broken.  Now, they do popup, but for me, they popup BEFORE I perform the task.  I've been getting achievements for defeating the level boss when I'd just started the level, for example.  This is a good problem to have, LOL, but nonetheless, I still like actually performing the task before getting that sweet achievement.  Other than that, I can't say enough good things about Aircraft Sketch Shooter.  A lot of the ultra-budget games on Steam are usually half-baked affairs.

5882,1473270,"""Are you smarter than the crowd"" is a party game in the same vein as something like a Jackbox Party Pack game, but of course, much different. It's just came out, and while a majority of the reviews currently base their scores off of technical issues, I'd like to approach this from an alternate point of view, while still addressing those later on.

A major reason one might have in this game would have to be because of the creator's renown for his previous work made through Source Filmmaker and Blender, with his unique and blunt presentation. Through the game's ever-prevalent, ""Host"", TipsyDuck's style and humor still has that same charm seen in his earlier work through these, strange pseudo human / egg people. Speaking of, this game does provide a good amount of customization for them: giving a wide variety of colors and name-tags to give your contestant/audience member. Additionally, the scenery around the sound-stage is visually nice to look at, and moving around the area has couple of funny details that add to the overall world-building.

While clearly not in a finished state, this game absolutely has potential. The main idea of the game is that you (if chosen as Contestant), are to face 9 other (max) players in a series of three, fairly simply puzzles. The challenge starts with a Jigsaw puzzle, a Memorization puzzle, and a ""Pattern Recognition"" puzzle, all designed to progressively increase your IQ score, with the goal of seeing who reaches the highest total. The first two puzzles are simple enough to do, though had trouble with the pattern recognition section, as after the first half of the puzzles the symbols began to look unique and I couldn't discern what was a pattern and what wasn't.

Overall, going through a round of the game is pretty entertaining, and with a group of friends going in first-hand, I imagine could result in some pretty fun times. At this stage, there aren't many players, so a good portion of the entertainment that would come from this is going to be lost right now. However, I had still found value in playing the rounds over again to both try my hand at getting a better score, as well as see one of the different endings depending on whoever achieves the highest amount. For those who are more globally competitive, there is additionally an ""I.Q."" Map that totals the average IQ for each country in the world that lists the smartest country by rank. It's a neat system, and it certainly adds a sense of replay-ability to beat other countries.

As for some constructive criticism design-wise, I think this game could benefit greatly from a large number of randomized voice-lines for the Host. With him having new things to say every moment the replay-ability could be substantially better, as I found myself playing multiple times to reach those unique endings, but hearing the Host say the exact same things each time was disappointing. And of course, the obvious bugs and technical issues that are currently in this version.

While I may not recommend you buy this right now, I would recommend keeping an eye on it if it's presentation is interesting to you.

Also who had the idea to make the chat only visible in the escape menu?? litteraly all games have it appear on the hud in-game.

So they've patched a lot of the bugs which was making playing the game annoying, but one of the main issues still stands, the game after the first initial play-throughs is boring. Not to mention there aren't a lot of people playing it at the time of this re-review.

I'm going to swap this from a not recommended to a recommended, but that's only because steam doesn't have a neutral rating. 

Honestly the game is going to need more mini-games and more variety otherwise it's just going to go the way of other steamer games, basically once the hype dies down, people likely won't play it anymore.



[h1]Original Review[/h1]
The game is currently too buggy to play, controls randomly stop working, the pause menu is non-existent and picking items up is unstable.

Edit: I've found spinning up your own games is a bit more stable. So I was able to try all of the games. Let me talk about them

[strike][h1]Shapes [/h1][/strike]
[strike]Honestly I'm not sure if this one is even part of the scoring as if you skip the introduction it doesn't make you go through it. (May require another player) but this one is (at-least in it's current state) near impossible to do, as if you're the contestant then you can't even fit the small blocks in due to an invisible wall or poor collision and if you're the audience then the bigger blocks are unstable when picking them up.[/strike] I've been told that this isn't part of the actual game and is a gag, so that explains it :P

[h1] The jigsaw puzzle [/h1]
This one this fairly straight forward and is fine, but gets boring when you've played it multiple times in a row.

[h1] Memory test [/h1]
This one is also straight forward and gets more difficult as it goes on, I'm not sure if the patterns change each time or if you could just simply take photos and just breeze through it each round after round.

[h1] Pattern test [/h1]
Some of the patterns are straight forward and others are not, I blame this probably on me having brain damage or something.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Right now in it's state, it's 50/50 on whether or not you'll successfully play a round and not get frozen controls, but even after that, the game will get repetitive quickly so unless they're planning adding on more content to it in the future, I don't think bug fixes will be enough to save this game's future.

Don't get me wrong, I understand the effort put in and speaking as a software engineer myself, this is the kinda thing that just ruins your day when you put hard work and effort into something and then it goes live in production and just breaks. It's not a good feeling and I truly feel bad for the developers, hell it also highlights that sometimes QA isn't 100% perfect, people make mistakes and miss things.

Once they fix the bugs then the game will be worth a try, but as I said it's going to need more content to help keep it afloat and fresh.",1,1649357667,88,0,12
5893,1473270,"I think this game would be great if it wasn't bugged to shit, and the fact that they haven't done much since launch to fix it shows how much Tipsy cares about this product.  I am immeasurably disappointing.",0,1660922625,11,0,3
5894,1473270,"Really cool idea for a game but at the moment it really really feels closer to a first playable alpha than a whole game. Which isn't too unfair considering it is also literally only $3. But still.

TLDR: With the current state of the game I'd recommend getting the game for yourself and a handful of friends that you know outside the game, playing a match or few together and having a laugh at all the first times seeing the fun jokes and gags, and then probably moving along. If the game is updated with more content it could be a lot more than that though.


Of the 3 puzzle types, 2 of them are the same every time. Which means that the game's already low starting popularity is going to be burned through VERY fast, as the only replayability is player interaction(in a game with no players or persistent lobbies), memorizing the correct answers to go for high scores and flex on noobs, or achievement hunting. The game definitely has a lot of room to improve in that regard of course, the puzzle types that were the same every time could 100% be used at the basis for a properly randomized version of the same puzzles, and more puzzle variety could be added.

But with the game being presented without any ""Don't worry more content is coming"" text in the description, it's hard to recommend it at all for solo play past grabbing it literally today on relaunch day and hoping you meet others doing the same.

Even then though the huge skill increase through playing multiple times(due to 2/3 content being repeated) means that any match involving a first time player and an existing player will probably be horribly one sided. Not that who wins is entirely the point but without enjoyable minigames it also sort of is?



Anyway here's a dump of some ideas roughly in order of how painful to maybe implement that could very much increase the game's chance of not immediately dying if hacked in with an update:

Show chat during gameplay and not just the esc screen. It's hard to actually engage with other players when they might not notice it's even possible to chat.

Seeing total online player/public lobby counts would help encourage people to see that the game does indeed have players they can wait for to get a bigger lobby.

Streamer quality of life options like disabling voice chat or custom faces could make it safer for people to try playing the game for a crowd on twitch. Not that I've encountered anyone running in to scream slurs, but the ability to preemptively deny that would theoretically make people more able to share the game to new players en masse.

Randomizing the order of the red tile and logic puzzles(Making them different every time would be better ofc but harder)

Lobbies persisting between rounds could encourage players to play more than twice before quitting(which is probably an overestimation going by anecdotal data as I've hosted rounds throughout today)

Joining lobby in progress to watch from the audience stand and perhaps harass the players could fit wonderfully into the chaotic environment and jokingly malicious tone. Imagine trying to do these puzzles with audience gremlins running around making things even worse and making fun of you for failing, it's wonderful!



Also small bug report list:

Have seen a few people mention the iq explainer video not playing, leaving them sitting their awkwardly for quite a while

Someone doing silly parkour fell out of the level. probably should include a trigger to teleport people back inside if they escape.

One round at the 'everyone head to your spots' part everyone fucked around for a while and the game seemed to not notice when we finally did organize. Dunno if that actually checks for people getting in their spots or just bad luck to freeze there but yeah.

Magnet ending stopped progressing the scene when winning with no crowd in attendance

For some reason one round as contestant I had a wheelchair too? Maybe that's just intended silliness idk

British Indian Ocean Territory(and others) is on the top 10 countries with 0 contestants. Also they break the formatting with the long name

5929,1473350,"I've been playing idle games for easily 10 years now, and this is just not that good.
Concept and art style are fantastic, and I really love that this feels new and unique for this genre
But where the game falls flat is the progression and scaling elements.
A typical idle game will generally have a handful of upgrade paths that will take you through the progression, And you generally know what you should be working towards. There's also the ""I wonder what will happen if I complete this milestone (e.g. prestige rewards, etc.).
With Gnorp, you get a little bit of the progression diversity, but there's no clear ""upgrade this area to generate more money"", or ""save up for this and it will be really worth it"".

I've found that early into the game I'm having to spend hours and hours in complete Idle, because the pricing of upgrades can take that long to save up for.

Typically a prestige tree increases the amount of income or resource generation for the next playthrough - however the perk tree in Gnorp adds minimal improvements for incredible cost. Typically, when prestiging in a new idle game I'm playing, you typically want to increase your output by about 300% in the second playthrough, if not more, otherwise it's not worth prestiging. This has been accurate for probably 90% of the idle games I've played. With Gnorp it feels closer to 50%, maybe less, and there doesn't appear to be a flat reward structure to prestiging (that I could see), so I don't often get too excited when it's time to prestige. The perks in general are not great, but this could just be because of early game.

The reward for saving up over hours and hours of idle time is a very small % increase in productive output.

The model of compression event, damage and collection rate is also a little bit confusing to start with. The reward for compression events is not super clear, or that great (e.g. Zybe upgrades add minimal in my experience). I find myself spending heaps of time trying to work out which upgrade I should spend my hard earned on, often not finding any meaningful or direct pathway to increasing production.

Not something I'd recommend if you're looking for an idle game, active idle game or incremental/upgrade-ey type of game.",0,1721910616,551,178,2

The story mode they have is pretty cool once you beat the game they have NG+ modes that raise the difficulty of each stage, level designs are way better than the first game and the boss fights are well put together as well, the upgrades are also better this time around and allow you to do more overall with your ship.

There's also a few extra modes you can unlock that adds more to the overall experience, if you like Habroxia then you'll like this one as well.

The only negative I have to say about this game is final boss was kind of a let down other than that it's still an enjoyable experience and I hope they eventually make Habroxia 3.",1,1708806410,1221,0,39

[b]Chill IV[/b] is a lewd maze game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Navigate a maze without touching any walls! The goal of each level is to guide a ball through two or more rings. If you touch a wall, you lose a heart -- if you lose three hearts, it's game-over. Thankfully, hearts can be restored just by [b]winning.[/b] Every five points you'll unlock a new CG (which is displayed on the left of the screen at all times). There are few CGs to see, but there are tons of Steam achievements to unlock related to high-scores and streaks. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
There is no story (and I'm not making one up).

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
There is no titlescreen -- it's straight to the game! The overall aesthetics are minimalistic, and I enjoyed the color palette. Between the pastel tones and soft-skinned waifu, [b]I approve.[/b] From the gearbox icon you can adjust audio and display preferences. There isn't a traditional gallery, but unlocked CGs can be cycled through via a hidden pop-up menu. The user-interface cannot be hidden.

[b]- The Goods-[/b]
The on-screen waifu can take on up to five animated poses. None of the poses are arousing. Rather, they are. . . [i]provocative[/i] at best. Though she is always naked, she doesn't actually show any goodies. I enjoyed her model -- it's a shame the developers didn't put her body to [b]work.[/b]

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
If you relish the idea of [b]deliberately[/b] dragging your cursor, [b]Chill IV[/b] may be a worthwhile buy for you. There is no worthwhile, unlockable content and I suspect most will find the gameplay boring. I understand that [b]Chill IV[/b] is intended to help you ""chill"" -- I found this game to be more stressful than relaxing. If [i]chilling[/i] is your goal, I'd recommend a puzzle game. A jigsaw or swippy-swappy has better [i]pick-up and play[/i] value, and they don't typically rely on arbitrary scores to egg you on.

Has potential
Needs work
Awkward/Confusing UI
Learning Curve
Nice Unique Ideas
Attractive when full screen
Developer seems nice & determined
It may be just me....


I love some of the settings but the user interface is really difficult for me to adjust to.  It's not very fluent. 

The lighting and layout options are awesome. It has some unique abilities compared to other writing software.

It's $3.49 right now. I'm sitting on the fence of refund. I'm not sure. I like nimble writer better. I'll probably get a refund and keep an eye on it for regular updates and polishing of the user interface. I'm kinda picky. It feels too awkward for me. 

I did a copy and paste using control + c & control + v, to paste a sentence on one page. I then clicked the image for the right page on the right side of the screen and it pasted what was on the left to the right. I can't figure out how to give it proper chapters and page numbers.  I can't justify it yet. They do seem to be doing updates and listening to people so, perhaps later I will get this again.  

Maybe there's some youtubers that covered this one?  Please read other reviews (different perspectives) and keep an eye on announcements and events made by the developers. (In Discussions/Community Hub. Latest updates and complaints are often found there.)",0,1722226738,22,22,158
5996,1473030,"It's nice. It's a very (emphasis on very) basic writing application with some customization to find a more appealing aesthetic. It frees you of what other distractions you might have and helps a ton with immersing yourself into your writing.
However, I have to say that it's lacking a lot in features. Which makes sense as the website for Qyllscape itself states: ""Qyllscape is a nearly minimalist tool that is not intended to replace all other editors. Instead, it is intended to make it easier to sit down and write during the times that it feels most difficult."", and it's true.

TL;DR - It's nice but not feature-rich enough to be worth $10. However if you don't mind investing a little, It's possible that it could reach the point of being worth all $10 in the future (updates are slow and highly anticipated). Remember, although I'm not recommending it, I'm not saying it's bad. It's simply not READY. (I recommend it if it's on at least a 50%+ sale though).

So, the first thing I want to bring up is that it's entirely plain-text. Rich Text Format is on the roadmap and being experimented with, so it's possible in the future that we might receive the ability to utilize italics, bold, underline, etc. in Qyllscape. This would be game-changing, as it's one of two main features missing that prevent me from recommending it just yet. So hopefully it's merely a matter of time before Qyllscape has it.

Second, the UI is quite unintuitive at first, though looking at it now it's pretty simple. The main problem is that the left and right ""pages"" of the ""book"" aren't.. pages in a book. Well, not in the way you'd expect it to be. It's an entire word document (think google docs where it scrolls down endlessly) pasted onto one ""page"" of the ""book"". Yes, it scrolls. This threw me off SO hard when I first realized it..  after all, I expected it to act like a book where once you reached the bottom of the page it would bring your text cursor to the top of the next page, but nope it scrolls down. To me this was a major let down as I was really excited with the idea of simulating the action of writing in a book (but typing) and was convinced that it would work as such. If you are writing a story, this can be very jarring and frankly breaks all immersion the rest of the features provide. As far as I saw from scouring the different settings and options, there is nothing that allows you to do this yet.
(I would love this please consider implementing this as a toggle-able setting.)

However, this does mean you can have what is essentially two separate docs open at once in one application. You can write on the left page while leaving comments or extra notes on the right page. 

Look, it's really nice. I like it a lot. But it's objectively just not worth the $10 yet and isn't a full-fledged product (keep in mind it was never advertised as one either) but rather someone's side project using the open source game engine Godot (which is REALLY cool, I never would have thought to do something like this with Godot). So if you don't mind writing in only plain-text and the fact that it's all in one ""page"" and scrolls... then yeah it's worth it. It's fun making a comfortable environment to write with the candlelights and sound effects. Qyllscape isn't abandoned so it should get more updates in the future (which are all so very much appreciated).",0,1720563399,219,0,34

Yes, the gameplay is a mixed bag. I played it in classic mode (hard), in which the protagonist is killed immediately by touching an enemy and resets at the nearest checkpoint for a limited number of lives. I found this mechanic poor in general and irritating as the game progresses, when enemy sprites become more difficult to evade. Playing the game in an easier mode may work better. There is also a hat system which allows power ups and can protect you from 1 or more hits. Unfortunately, you are allowed to carry only 2 hats at a time and changing them is awkward. In addition, you lose them immediately when you receive damage and need to find an owl (I think?) in a random location to wear them again.

Still, you cannot dislike this game. The story is compelling and the characters are fleshed out beyond a stock narrative. The music also evokes a great GameBoy-ish atmosphere. Give Tako a chance and you will be handsomely rewarded!",1,1628472787,2365,0,17

I decided to try it out, and yes, the game is as good as described.

The trailer makes it looks like it's a kirby game, but the very introduction of the game makes it clear it's going to be more than that. (You start the game before a ship gets assaulted by squids, killing everyone at board.)

It really reminds me of a mix of Kirby (platforming segments) and Link's Awakening.

6003,1472540,"A fantastic retro style platformer taking inspiration from many retro games like Trip World, Kirby's Dream Land, and Zelda II. The variety of hats especially allows players to tackle platforming challenges in many different ways while still keeping the game challenging and engaging. The one major complaint I had is that there were several points in which off screen enemies killed me without giving me a chance to react. I do think the enemy placement could use a little work for sure. But aside from that, I think this game excels at what it sets out to do. The story in particular is great and has many plot twists, with the chiptune soundtrack being fantastic all the way through.

6004,1472540,"I really wanted to like this game, I really did, I saw it's charm and silly premise and really wanted to immerse myself in a gameboy-esque world filled with colorful characters and a fantastical story. Little did I know what I was getting into wasn't just a game that would look like a gameboy release, but also feel like one, all the jankiness and sometimes downright hostile design included as was customary for that era. Seriously, If you had given me this game with no context whatsoever the only thing that would've tipped me off about it not actually being an authentic gameboy release is the fact that the character sprites don't actually follow pixel grids and the main character's jump physics let him slide up corners to make otherwise impossible jumps, so really I must commend the dev's dedication on going all in on the theme.

The story is... fine. The general concept and ideas I liked a lot, but it's when it comes to the execution that a lot was left to be desired. Now it's important to mention: I played this game in english, which I can tell is not the original language of the game, so it's possible that there were some things lost in translation or perhaps the translator just wasn't very good at conveying the original message in an elegant way (there are some minor spelling/grammar mistakes here and there so it really wouldn't surprise me if that were the case). However, as it stands I must report that dialogue in english was written in an incredibly stiff and artificial way. None of the characters feel like actual people, they're mostly just tropes and one-dimensional plot devices, and they stay very simple even when the story attempts to develop them beyond that. This would honestly be fine if the game was more self-aware and tongue-in-cheek, and while it DOES have moments that are more humorous which work far better imo, those are honestly quite rare. For a game called ""Save me Mr Tako!"" which is centered around a conflict between humans and a race of sentient octopuses (that's what the game calls them, don't yell at me for not using 'octopi') the tone is weirdly serious throughout, and it does not work in the game's favour as most of the dramatic moments really fall flat. There are also some minor inconsistencies in the worldbuilding as well as characters sometimes not making the most logical decisions or other plot contrivances, but honestly if you get into the headspace of this being an actual gameboy-era game this stops bothering you as such things were par for the course in most older games as well.

The gameplay is... nothing special. Really, I would almost call it boring, but it did manage to keep me mildly entertained for about six hours so that would be somewhat disingenuous. The game has two main mechanics going for it: shooting ink to immobilize enemies, letting you jump on them to do platforming that would be otherwise impossible and hats that alter your shooting style. The first mechanic is what really carries this game, without it this would be a plain 'ole regular platformer that would probably feel even blander, however the game really fails to utilize this mechanic in new and exciting ways. Once you've beaten World 2 you've pretty much seen everything there is to it and the only things that will change are how many times you actually need to shoot an enemy to properly immobilize them, which does nothing to enhance the gameplay and only serves as an annoyance. In fact, this game has a lot of annoyances, like the fact that every time you die you lose the hat you're currently wearing and the only way to get it back is to take it from a checkpoint (you can only recover one hat this way btw.) or finish the stage you're currently in to go into another stage and get it from the hat NPC. Not to mention there is always only one checkpoint per level and dying in a pit doesn't always leave you in a good position to run all the way back to it. Seriously, why? Why couldn't you just let the players have all the hats in their ""inventory"" and freely swap between them or something of that sort? This is less bad in the beginning of the game, as most hats basically just have the same effect but make you shoot different looking objects or make your shots have different trajectories, 99% of which are so insanely gimmicky you will never actually find them useful in any situation whatsoever. Legitimately, the default shot your character has is the best in the game by far, there is absolutely no reason to put on like 90% of the hats beause they will either do nothing or actually hinder your gameplay. The only hats that are even worth paying attention to are literally the first one you get, which grants you one extra hit before death, and the upgraded version of that which gives you two hits.  Still, like I said before this wouldn't be so bad if you didn't actually need any hats to progress in the game, and for the most part when you DO need a hat the game is kind enough to not take it away after a death... provided it gives it to you in the first place. Sometimes, however, you'll be faced with challanges in stages where you're not provided with the right hat for the job, meaning you'll have to actually carry it throughout the level to the place where you need it, hoping you don't get hit on the way there because if you do you'll have to run all the way back to the checkpoint (if possible) and then hope you don't get hit again when running back where you were heading in the first place. It's tedious and unfun, and most of the time you WILL get hit either because of the janky hitboxes, unexpected enemy behaviour, or simply because you've started being so fed up with the game you started being sloppy which will just make you even more frustrated. This game really is not that hard, I've been playing on the medium difficulty where you only get one hit by default and I've never gotten stuck on a section for longer than around 5-7 lives. However, while not hard, the game does like to throw just barely avoidable bullshit at you like fish and birds jumping at you off the edge of the screen, or jumps that look deceptively easy but will actually throw you into spikes because you bumped your head on a corner. I don't consider that difficulty, it's just another annoyance. Speaking of annoyances, here's another hat-related one: the button the game tells you ""swaps"" your active and stored hats doesn't actually do that, in fact it only discards your active hat and makes your stored hat your new active, but then when you pick up the discarded hat it becomes the active one again. That means that whenever you actually want to swap your hats, you need to discard them both, then make sure to pick up the one you DON'T want first, then finally pick up the one you actually want. Fun.

Lastly, the level design is... bland. There's just no way around saying that, the levels feel very repetitive and same-y. None of them really stand out in my memory and a lot of them just blend together into a blur. The only exceptions might be the ""special"" levels signified by the castle doorways on the world map, but even then those usually go for long enough that parts of the level start to blend in with themselves. Generally, I think this game could actually gain a lot by ""trimming the fat"" so to speak. There are a lot of levels where nothing interesting happens at all, you just move from point A to point B in the exact same enviorment you were in the level prior, with the exact same platforming challanges, just in different places or with slight variations and not even the story gets progressed in any way at all. Those kinds of levels you could completely cut out of the game and nothing would be lost, in fact I'd argue that it would improve the game by letting the other, actually meaningful levels stand out more instead of being sandwiched between complete filler that shares the same coat of paint.

All in all, I wish the best to the developers, but this just ain't it.",1,1710387865,1338,0,17
6005,1472540,"It starts off well being a cute, Kirby-like gameboy platformer. The combat however you realize early on has next to no variety. You use hats to change your equipped ability, but most of them tend to be useless or actively a hindrance to your progress. Most of the stages feel fine enough, however when you get into some of the later dungeons they suddenly are *extremely* easy to get lost in. The game expects you to remember what every location is called without any indicator on the world map screens so you find yourself just wandering around until you finally stumble on the correct one again. For the kind of game it is, it goes on way too long as well. I expected to be done with it far sooner than it was and as time went on it was evident that I was not having fun anymore. Everything felt like a chore by that point. Sad this didn't quite get where I wanted it, maybe it's good for others.

6008,1472540,"A nice Gameboy aesthetic retro platformer 2D pixel art game that revives Trip World / Kirby / Clash At Demonhead game style.  It has good art and half-decent feel, and I'm going to check out any future game by these developers, but I have to give this one a harsh review.  The problem is:

0) Over-written like so many indy games.  Way too many textboxes and few of them are good.  You might expect some funny quirky textboxes, when you consider the title is ""Save me Mr. [Octopus]"", but the text was almost like irrelevant strings of boredom.  It seems that many indy game designers are self-absorbed and want to cram as many (bland) textboxes into the player's face as possible.  That's not gameplay, people.  It's mediocre, it's intrusive, it's irritating to constantly click through.  This isn't High School English Class personal fiction sharing time.

1) Bland level designs.  You jump here and there, but it's boring and uninteresting compared to the good classic platformers.  The geometry doesn't feel like a place and isn't cool to travel through.

2) Tedious annoying bad-feeling structure.  As you go along, the game switches back and forth at seemingly random points.  One moment you're in a town apparently talking to people and seeing unclear textboxes about hats or mini-games, the next moment you're in a standard Kirby/Mario level area.  Unlike other games that have both safe and normal/dangerous areas, this one was incoherent and neither part felt quite right.

3)  General Uncreativity.  At one point, two octopuses sing a song which they say is their special octopus song (or something like that).  You would expect some kind of interesting not-perfectly-human-sapien melody and harmony chiptune here right?  Nope.  It's the most generic ""castle king trumpet"" tune ever in history.  Why bother?  How can octopuses in a goofy octopus game have a bland cliche human tune?

It's worse than all the games it pays tribute to.  I played it for 30 minutes, it's fine as a thing, I'm not mad I paid for it, and I will stlil follow these devs to see what else they do, but I don't want to load it up ever again.",0,1700960472,63,32,9
6009,1472540,"For a game that starts out as a Kirby/Shantae clone, I've been surprised so far. The gameplay/levels are simple enough, but the mechanics change often enough that I never felt bored.

Wont lie, I can't be bothered to write my own review, but seeing how few reviews are on this game I want to help its review score a bit. Heres someone elses review which summarises it perfectly (source Hardcore Gamer):

It’s hard to describe just how enjoyable Save Me Mr Tako is. It seems so simple and quaint from the outside, but contains a meaningful adventure that won’t soon be forgotten. The original release left many little things to be desired, but the Definitive Edition comes back in full force and ready to give Tako another change in the limelight so he can prove his eight tentacles aren’t just for show. Anyone who likes platforming, good adventures or just that classic Game Boy vibe should not miss out on one of the most enjoyable little indie titles ever made with Save Me Mr Tako: Definitive Edition.",1,1644859463,129,0,19

6014,1472540,"Good game, love that you can play as an Octopus. Story is pretty good, better than most platformers. If you like a platforming experience with good story, you'll like this game.

It also works well with Proton, so it should run well on Steam Deck too.",1,1635352770,187,0,17
6015,1472540,"Played this on the Switch, and got it here to support the developer. If you like platformers or had an original Gameboy, this game is a must.
The story is grandiose and emotional, and the characters are fun and memorable, and you get very attached to them by the end.
Gameplay is varied thanks to the “hats” mechanic, and it never gets boring. Some hats like the ones summoning cats and dogs are a particular standout. It is a challenging game, but with the new “heart” difficulty on the definitive edition, it should be at anyone’s reach.
If you are a fan of classic platformers, I cannot recommend this game enough.

6017,1472540,"I had bought the original version back in 2018 since the concept of this game peaked my interest greatly (Gameboy inspired platformer with a plot that stars octopuses, which are my favorite sea animals) and I had a lot of fun with it so I was more than happy to double dip for the definite edition! 

I really enjoyed the plot and it's message of learning to love and accept others regardless of differences they can't control and I really appreciate there is now a mode that will let players who mainly want to enjoy the story have an easier time. The platforming and difficulty was fairly balanced and when it got tough it didn't feel unfair to me. The soundtrack was great to listen to and it sounds like music that was made for an actual Gameboy game. The hat gimmick was creative and while I few felt samey (the Piolos Babies and Diane's Shield for example) they were really fun to find and figure out which hat I needed to discover stuff.

I don't have any complaints since the definitive edition fixed the issues I had with the original game so I would give a solid recommendation to anyone who has any interest in this lovely game! Do it for Tako!",1,1621321709,4828,0,4

The characters you're supposed to follow sometimes get hit by traffic, admittedly this is funny but it transports them far away really quickly and your possibility of failing is extremely high. Again, I'd recommend waiting for the developer to fix some of these bugs before considering buying this game.

UPDATE: The developer listened to my review and implemented some suggestions so there's a few things crossed out. The movement is smoother than previous with the WASD implementation thus making it easier to move around and look at the same time. With this the game is better to play, other than a few bugs that need to be wrinkled out and a few touches to the UI I'd say the game is almost ready to play.",0,1606863102,48,0,21

6028,1472600,"What I liked about this game:
- Collecting minerals and digging tunnels is fun
- Exploring deeper into the caves and taking out hives is fun
- The return trip to the orbiter is long but its eventful
- Getting to the orbiter and buying upgrades after bringing a big load of minerals feels good
- The [spoiler]sky boss and the space snake [/spoiler] boss are fun to fight


What I dislike about this game:
- Very low amount of settings. You can toggle fullscreen, turn off sound and music (completely) and disable the robots speech, but that's about it.
-[strike]I can't hide the controls panel from the bottom of the HUD, sometimes it gets in the way of where i'm trying to look[/strike] (EDIT: new option allows you to hide the controls list!)
- ""ooh, whats this big cave over here?"" And while I'm tunneling towards it, ""Astronaut was killed by [spoiler]sarlacc pincher[/spoiler]""
- For me in the beginning - middle part of game, the difficulty was increasing a bit too fast, around threat level 3 I had trouble surviving because the small enemies were able to take off 60% of my health in one hit. But after upgrading life support and weapons, it was less of an issue.


What I want to see improved in this game:
- The map. I would like to zoom in on it and see where are my tunnels. Right now you can't really see them.
- The ""hover mode"" on the shuttle is awful. Half the time it rejects me launching into flight mode because its too close to the ground, got my shuttle wrecked a few times because of an incoming group of triple shooting enemies and this. I would suggest better mobility in hover mode.
- [strike]The underground mini-bosses[/strike] (EDIT: The unfair boss i was complaining here got a change so that it no longer kills you without warning) 


Conclusion:
I got this game because it reminded me of those 2D mining flash games I used to enjoy playing more than a decade ago. Plus I like to support indie game developers. 
Descending down onto the planet, starting to dig for resources, making sure you have enough coal, fighting off some enemies, exploring into caves, retreating to your ship, returning to the cave, taking out the hives, 
exploring even deeper and mining a huge load of gold and diamonds before returning to the orbiter for a break is a fun experience.
Even though this game has some issues, I'm optimistic that some of these are going to get fixed. The recent patch was a step in the right direction. Even then for the most part the game remains quite fun.",1,1613933364,2253,0,9
6029,1472600,Great game with a good looking lo-fi aesthetic. You get to pilot your own ship and land on asteroids and planets to plunder them of their resources. The music and over all ambiance is great. I really like the miniature gun battles with the strange local fauna. It gives me the vibe of playing a prequel to Starbound on Atari. I would actually say the atmosphere is better than Starbound.,1,1646089852,158,0,2
6030,1472600,"Fun 2D exploration game. The side quests do well to break up the overall grind, and you get that sense of achievement as your suit, weapons, and ship become more formidable due to the fruits of your mining labor.",1,1615090053,259,0,16
6031,1472600,"Very cool game! Spent several hours on the first planet alone, and every planet has unique enemies with different attack patterns, which makes the combat dynamic across sessions.
The game itself plays like Terraria & a classic space shooter game, without the building aspect of the former. Reminds me of one of my favorite childhood games Solar Jetman (NES), but with much better / more intuitive controls. 
Fast paced action perfectly complements the grindy mining. 

My only real gripe is the amount of Biomatter needed to warp; when i had finished all other goals i still had 50% of the biomatter left to collect. I think 2000 would be good for balance, alternatively, make it more common so you reach the goal a little faster.",1,1618865281,484,0,5
6032,1472600,"Grind elevated to art.  They made a game that is 100% grind, but it's so much fun that the grind becomes the goal. 

Terrene is a very cool game.  It is a spiritual successor to Evidence of Life, which I loved.  This is a very similar game, but while it does a lot of the same things, I feel it does them all better.  Please don't place too much emphasis on the amount of time I played it, as I have also been playing the via itch.io version for some time.

So tired of it already, Going back to terraria. but good start. also need to tell you that most upgrades are consumable making it teedious i maxed out my stats my dogs and upgraded the ship to max everything in 14 hours and exhausted of the repetative work not play but to much grindy at this time

Thanks for this nice game.",1,1681309500,269,0,5
6035,1472600,"This game was unexpectedly immersive.  It also weaves together a few different genre styles in a very cohesive way.
You play as an astronaut tasked with collecting resources from a procedurally generated planet.  Your main hub is a static station in space; where you park your spacecraft, store resources, and upgrade things.
From there, you use your spacecraft to travel back and forth between your hub and the planet.  Your ship is equipped with weaponry, and that's where the shmup aspect comes in.  You'll be tackling asteroids, and a good variety of enemies ranging from small to boss-level.  
On the planet's surface; once you're off the ship, it then becomes sort of a platforming/mining game.  You'll use a nice array of weapons to battle a different range of enemies here.  You're also equipped with a mining laser for collecting resources.  The more resources you bring back to the hub, the more dangerous the enemies on the planet become.  So there's a tiny bit of resource management involved when deciding what to upgrade with said resources.
I found the whole thing ridiculously addictive.  ""Just one more trip to the planet.""  Then I realize I've been playing for a solid four hour block.  >_>
Nostalgic but unique.  It can be incredibly challenging at times, sure, but not in a rage-inducing way.  Definitely takes a slot in my starred favorites!",1,1619500146,1731,0,117

6039,1472600,"In Terrene you play as a space miner tasked with extracting minerals from an untamed and hostile alien planet. The game expertly merges multiple genres, from shmup dogfights with giant insect swarms to the tense resource management and close quarters combat of deep cave mining. Beyond the safety of your space station you are given a ship and are given few instructions or limitations, just a vast and dangerous world to explore. The surface of the planet teems with life, multiple biomes and alien ecosystem with you at the bottom of the food chain. Combat is quick, brutal, and tactical, especially during a swarm. Resources are just streamlined enough that you have to keep an eye on your o2 without it bogging down the action. When you fly back up to your space station you get to use the resources you've mined to upgrade your suit and ship, buy powerful new weapons, and track down bosses and collectibles with the scanner. 

If you enjoy No Man's Sky, Steamworld Dig, and Luftrausers, definitely check out this game. It merges the best elements of these into a seamless and emergent experience, with a greater focus on tight and responsive combat, potent survival elements and diverse environments",1,1617490734,407,0,4
6040,1472600,"What a blast - this game has so many biomes, varied enemies, power ups and weapon types. It is insanely fun, strategic and I really enjoy exploring, mining and surviving on a totally alien world. The music is very atmospheric and the SFX are top notch. The artwork is brilliant and stays true to the original EOL.",1,1617319701,275,0,8
6041,1472600,"This one is full of little surprises and lots of fun in spite of some rough edges. Your purpose here is to dig holes to collect resources that you use on upgrades that make you better at digging holes. It is a satisfying game loop that keeps you going with endless small rewards. Early on, it seems like you reach the limits of what Terrene has to offer but more complexity slowly reveals itself, giving you motivation to press on. 

As far as the rough edges: the map sucks, I found the combat clunky and there is no way to avoid it and some features where neither explained well nor did I intuit on their function. (Maybe I am just dumb but a magnifying glass icon on the map does immediately make me think there's is something there to examine but something you click on to zoom in--which you can't really do.)

Overall though, I am finding this a great way to occupy my time in both short and long sessions. You can take twenty minutes and just do some mining/upgrading or if you have a bigger chunk of time you can endeavor to defeat a boss or complete a larger objective. I am finding myself putting in a little time every night and will likely keep on it for some time and have found myself recommending it to quite a few people.

[outdated old review for reference] 
This was pleasant. I've seen and done just about all the major stuff I can, and can now mine through planets with ease. After finishing my first planet I was already finding myself very overpowered, but that's just because I kept to the lowest level planets. To anybody else playing I would recommend going for tougher ones, like going up by at least one level each time, so it still has some sort of stakes.

For some things that I might have enjoyed it more for, maybe if the biomatter limit was a pinch smaller, and I also would have liked some more unique rewards for beating some of the extra stuff like the space station, labyrinth, and glitch maze, Maybe even depending on the level of the planet you're on.

I guess my only issue is that I wish there were some kind of in-game reference for crafting recipes. Let me know if I'm missing it, I always leave comments on.

It's budget and it feels like it, but if you get into exploration/crafting/Metroidvania it's definitely worth the money. I honestly despise crafting in games, and it still works for me.",1,1680981349,1339,0,55

[b]Hot Hentai Puzzle Vol.1[/b] is a lewd jigsaw puzzle game. . . with no hentai.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Arrange puzzle pieces to assemble an image. [b]Hot Hentai Puzzle Vol.1[/b] is a collection of (ten) jigsaw puzzles, of varying difficulty. As pieces ""magnetize"" to their corresponding locations, it's easy to go ""fishing"" by drag-n'-dropping pieces into vaguely correct areas. However, if you're having too much trouble you can toggle an image of the completed puzzle. To my knowledge, there is no ""cheat"" button.  

[h1]Story[/h1]
There is no story (and I'm not making one up).

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
As much as I liked the waifus, the titlescreen is a joke -- and so is the user-interface. The game looks incredibility cheap! Audio can be muted at anytime via the sound icon. From the camera icon on the titlescreen you can review unlocked CGs. They cannot be fullscreened, and they are rendered in a 1:1 ratio. For feck's sakes, we don't use those stupid box monitors anymore!

[b]- The Goods-[/b]
There are ten static CGs, each with an undressed variant. Each CG shows an anime lady in a provocative position, sometimes with a little [i]drippy-drip[/i] from her lady-parts. The artwork is. . . eh. I found the CGs to look somewhat plain or discount. Also, [b]there's no hentai.[/b]

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
If you're here for jigsaws (and not [b]hentai[/b]), this title is an okay buy (during a sale!) The content will likely keep you entertained for roughly half an hour. However, the adult-content probably won't keep you entertained at all. The artwork isn't great, and there's similarly priced titles that are better in [i]pretty much every way.[/i] If you're in desperate need of jigsaw puzzles, [b]Hot Hentai Puzzle Vol.1[/b] may be a good candidate for you. However, I think you're better off saving your money for [i]something better.[/i]

6069,1472660,"This could have been a solid 7/10 if they bothered to finish it. The vibe is nice, and the completely casual nature of it- it doesn't even have a calendar to track how long you've been playing- would have made it a very nice, completely no stress experience to cool down after work... if it wasn't so buggy. The targeting system is just bad- trying to feed a specific duck always means standing above it and waiting for it to walk away from the other animals, otherwise it's simply impossible to choose that specific one among all others that got stuck standing in this one specific corner. Speaking of animals, you better not put their pens anywhere near a bush, or you will start losing the animals one by one while they inevitably wander too close to the bush, start floating above it and become impossible to click on. storage chests also have a bad issue where they will just refuse to let you choose the item you're pointing to, until you FIRST pick up and put back away the first item in your backpack. I expect this is some weird bug where the game was designed to be played with a controller, which would always choose your 1st backpack slot to be selected when opening a chest, and they just never bothered to fix the targeting to follow where your mouse is hovering? Did this game go through any Quality Assurance at all? Surely if they had even one person hunting for game bugs, they would have noticed this by opening ANY chest even once? And if you commit the grave mistake of storing your quest items in a chest for later, you might as well reset the whole save, because I just lost any hope of progressing the game to my spare robot parts randomly poofing out of existence from my storage chest.
I expect this has a chance of being someones favourite childhood game, because the vibe really is nice on the surface- about as much as Spore was my favourite childhood game, where, as a a child, I had more patience for unfinished products.",0,1720472009,1270,0,1
6070,1472660,"Message is good but game is quit shallow. It really should be in Early Access and add more features to it and really work on the story line.

6071,1472660,"[h1]If you like cosy games, this is definitely one for the list![/h1]

If you're here for a Stardew-esque experience, this isn't exactly it. Yes, farming and keeping animals is a part of this game, BUT the majority of gameplay is centred around vacuuming and drilling through huge piles of waste. If you like the therapeutic but repetitive satisfaction of cleaning, like in games like Power Wash Sim or House Flipper, you'll love this game (I definitely do)!

There are some minor visual bugs and clipping through areas where you may get stuck (this has only happened to me once so far), but it's easy to work around by teleporting to your farm, or another nearby location.

[h3]The best things about this game are the cute art style, adorable animals - you can put cute hats on your animals - addictive and therapeutic cleaning mechanic, easy farming, and lots of decorating![/h3]

6072,1472660,I really enjoyed this game! It has a very laid back style and yet is engaging. Fun to farm and yet theres exploring and a cute story. I would love more content!,1,1720808378,1696,1,1
6073,1472660,"Edit: The game gets really buggy as you progress. Quests auto-completing then denying player's critical quest items, animal pathing preventing you from building things anywhere they step, piles of junk not disappearing when you vaccume them up, or they disappear but their collision box is still there and remains there post-restart. For this reason I'm changing my recommendation from a yes to a no. I look forward to these things getting patched, but progress on that seems a bit slow... I'll gladly revert this when the game is fixed and playable again.
---------------------------

A good game that needs some story re-organizing, combat needs improving (but is serviceable), and some QoL fixes. I love digging through the stacks of trash. I think there's a good 'buried stuff to trash pile' ratio. 

I think the game would benefit from the story being introduced in a shorter manner. The first questions you're going to the farm to answer is ""where is my grandpa"" and ""is he okay?"" to which for the last 4 hours I've been met with 'I'll explain whether or not your grandpa is even alive after you do this long laundry list of tasks'. Then the next guy you meet wants you to make the chickens love you before he's willing to tell you if your grandads even alive either. I feel like I'm being prevented from even starting the story! It feels like they're all pulling a huge dick-move against this girl who came all the way back from their coveted station-placement to make sure her last living family member is still alive. I'd compare the feeling to waiting at the airport. You get the quest item they wanted and suddenly you need to do another task for them before they'll tell you anything, then they just keep pulling the rug out from under you. Ffs chicken! Let me play the game! You've got such an impactful setup to the story, but you won't let me explore it until the chickens adore me!

Other than that frustration I've having a good time.",0,1721491071,1010,0,106
6074,1472660,"The game is cute and fun. But the lags are cruel, the 3-D-perspective is weird, the movement unsmooth. The game is about planting, collecting, placing objects and decoration. None of those is possible the way you want. You want to create a garden - the frame rate drops, you want to decorate the house with wallpaper - the walls dissapear, you want to walk around in the world - the movement is clumsy and has damaging effect on  your eyes. I played 2 times longer than 2 hours and had awful headake next days. The game seems unfinished: a nice idea badly executed.

6085,1472160,"If u're not the developer, please skip until the end of the review.

Things that need to improve IMO
- UI
- Bgm and Sound effect every scene
- Gameplay honestly need a lot of improvements, like
- Ingame tutorial
- Ingame UI
- Add effect (not only sound) when u press the button (when there's no beat) so player can know if the control are working
- ""Q"" and ""P"" is kinda hard to see because of the lightning
- Long note / slider a bit hard to see at the first time
- Add a miss sound effect after u got several combo like higher than 10
- Add a delay like 3 seconds after unpausing please
- Hit points need to be fixed I guess, I accidentally pressed a button when the note still like far and I missed it, and it break my combo
- Long note / slider mechanic, it's a bit too hard I guess, I missed a lot at the end of the slider even I tried to timed it so many times
- Post score / score board after u finished a beatmap is kinda.. ehh.. change it to anime or smth theme better.. like osu.
- Game is too grindy.. put higher points please, or 1 song for 1 scene is really ok I think..
- Maybe add like auto mode? Not all people can play rythm game :P

For H scene, maybe Voice Actor? aha.. art are pretty nice I love it, but sadly no VA / sound effect


Alright, In the end, this is a rythm and visual novel game combined, where the story is u're become the owner of 4 abandoned cats, and if u take good care of them, they become catgirls and u know what happen ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I'm sorry I have to use cheat engine to unlock all of the scene because I'm tired and frustated holding my dong for about a hour trying to get into the H scene, since the main reason I bought this game is for that.. (hey don't blame me..)

Overall:
Gameplay: 5.6/10
Art / CGs: 9/10 (yes, 9/10)",1,1611950923,68,0,67
6086,1472160,"Note; I am judging this mostly on the rhythm game aspect. I don't really care about the hentai stuff so I am not a good judge of that. I mean, I reckon those into it can fap to it just fine? 

Anyway, so... the rhythm game. It's okay. It's fun for what it is for the price this sells for. I definitely have played better rhythm games, but, it was pretty much what I'd expected from a rhythm game inside a hentai VN game. So, I am gonna give it a recommend for fans of the rhythm game genre who wanna try something else for some hours. Personally, my goal is to FC/perfect all songs eventually. :D

+ Can change keybinds (this was actually a big wow, played too many full rhythm games where ya can't!)
+ Nice clean visuals 
+ No weird suggestive shit during the playing of the song so I can play this without cringing to death. Looking at you beat refle, plz why.

- No calibration/offset options
- Each song has a set difficulty you cannot change
- There are only 12 songs total and I don't think you can unlock any more
- Not keysounded (where you play the actual notes when you hit the right key, the music plays regardless of hit or miss)

This can be a pro or a con depending on what you dig:
o The keys do click when you hit a note, some find this helpful, some find this annoying; there is no option to turn this off afaik
o The judgment in this game is VERY strict. 

That said, the rhythm game aspect is not really beginner friendly I don't think, and the game is rather grindy if you care about just unlocking the hentai scenes. And I guess... uh, many people do NOT play this necessarily for the rhythm game aspect so I can imagine it can be a bit frustrating to most? Shout-out to my desperate 18+ homies out there; porn is easy to find on the internet yo.

But yeah, honestly, don't imagine most would really play this for the rhythm game aspect. There's also definitely tons better rhythm games out there. I am just a huge fan of rhythm games so I'll play any I can find since it's fun. But yeah. If you happen to like it, and  want more, let me recommend some actual good rhythm games; DJMAX, Musynx, Muse Dash, Spin Rhythm, and EZ2ON are all great!",1,1668174294,118,0,309

If you feel like gambling and do intend to buy two or more of these skins, then the price might be worth it. However, you'll have a better time picking one and buying it through the game. While still gambling, it can be much cheaper than $60 USD as 25 rolls in game costs $25. That's 5 more rolls for half the price in this pack.

6098,1472330,"The store page should be much clearer about this not actually being the ZX Spectrum game running in an emulator, but a remake running in the Unity engine.
It's playable enough, but not an accurate depiction of what it originally looked or played like, despite reusing the Spectrum graphics.
What you'll instantly notice for example is that while the game uses classic low res pixel graphics, the physics and movement don't adhere to the 'resolution' of these graphics. You'll see your ship move smoothly between pixels, which of course results in the pixels of the ship and the backgrounds not lining up to the same grid, making it kinda hard to look at.

This is hard to recommend, they obviously put work into remaking the game in Unity, but I don't know for whom? Anybody interested in picking this up surely would just've wanted the emulated product bundled with some goodies, and if you're porting it to a new engine, you could just as well make it a sequel or spiritual successor with new art that better fits the new physics model.

I don't wanna give this either a thumbs up or down, the game is what it is, and if the store page actually told you what it was, it wouldn't be a bad homage to NOMAD.",0,1624800858,5,0,11

6100,1472380,"A very basic Unity platformer ported from mobile, that should tell you everything you need to know, but I'll elaborate.

Currently there's 6 levels (8, if you want to be generous and count the tutorials), all you do is advance to the right across five sections with occasional checkpoints until you reach the goal. Every now and then you may have to deviate a little to collect a key or a power up, but otherwise it's pretty straight forward.  

You control this game's representations of famous thieves Lupin and Goemon, besides your basic walking and jumping (which also serves as your main attack), what differentiates each character is their secondary jump ability and the ""skills"" they can use. Lupin can descend slowly to cover longer distances if you press and hold the jump button again while in mid-air, while Goemon can do a second jump instead, which seems to reset every time you bounce off an enemy. Skills are a secondary method of attack that can be used as long as you find the appropriate item on the stage, they have a cool down so they can only be used sparingly, Lupin has a projectile and burst attack, while Goemon has a dash that damages enemies and the ability to turn invincible for a few seconds.

In a few of the levels the detective characters (Holmes and Heiji) pop up, these characters are invincible and will chase you relentlessly until the end of the level, though you can't kill them you can jump on them to get a boost and also stun them for like a second.

You have a life bar and 3 lives to get through a level. There are many things on the stages that can damage you but the damage they inflict is minor, you really need to take a beating in order to deplete your life bar, realistically your biggest threat is the platforming, as all the levels take place over multiple floating platforms where missing a jump will make you fall to your death.

There are a number of gems spread across each level and the game keeps count of how many you collected, though as of now, collecting all of them doesn't seem to do anything.

Tough simple, the levels are almost fun to play, they flow well enough that it feels satisfying to rush through them when you know what you're doing, problem is, the platforming is really awkward. It's really hard to describe unless you experience it, but the jumping is terrible, it almost feels like it was programmed by somebody that understands what a platformer is, yet has no prior experience programming jumping or other basic physics essential to a good platformer. To its credit, the game has both keyboard and controller support (though it controls as awkwardly with either one), there's no key remapping but there's only 2 buttons besides movement and the skill button is rarely used, so it's not a big deal. Annoyingly though, as a carry over from mobile, the controls only works during the actual levels, you still need to use the mouse to navigate the menus and dialog scenes.

Speaking of which, there's VN style sequences before and after each level. These are supposed to be a selling point of the game and seem to have a yuri focus, but as the game is currently only available in Japanese, I can't really comment on them. Just superficially looking through them ,they seem to be somewhat short and about the same level of quality you would find in a gacha game or the like, minus voice acting.

That's pretty much all there is to the game, all in all, if you ignore the VN parts, you can complete all the levels in an hour or less, almost feels more like a demo than a full fledged game. The credits and dev's website do promise and episode 3 and 4 sometime down this year, but unless those have more than the current 3 levels per chapter, I hardly doubt it's worth the wait. What's weird is that the game has somewhat decent production values, the character designs are cute and well represented in-game, the setting is interesting and gives me Milky Holmes vibes, each individual character has their own VA (though the voice lines are sparce), and the game even has its own original title song with vocals, of which you can buy an official single CD from their webpage, along with some acrylic goods on their website. It seems they even paid a number of low profile vtubers to promote the game. There's clearly some money and effort put towards the presentation and promotion of the game, it's a shame the actual gameplay doesn't live up to it.",0,1679372335,67,0,18

6102,1472450,"The climate expansion adds a new dimension to evolution. In the original the only threats are starvation and predators, climate adds having to protect your species from temperature. It adds a fourth trait slot to all species and a bunch of new traits to help you deal with this new threat.

The DLC is well executed, it looks great and I did not encounter any bugs. The user interface extensions are very intuitive. Unfortunately, there are no new campaign missions and hopefully this expansion will not fragment the user community and make it harder to find online games.

So is this worth getting? I would say yes. Climate is the best expansion for evolution and it adds a lot of chaos and makes each play through more different. In the physical board game this added chaos could be problematic as it tended to overwhelm new players. The major advantage of the digital version is that you can play against people who have more experience and are better able to deal the added complexity.",1,1626340482,0,0,26

The main complaint is that this adaptation doesn't really capture the beautiful art of the boardgame. Instead, it's this bizarrely skeumorphic kludge.

This ""game"" isn't a game its a scam tech demo that barely works, designed to trick people into giving them money. If this was free I wouldn't play it, seriously. It is that bad.

This is the entire game:

You spawn into a grey empty room that has nothing in it but the games logo, a door, and a camera screen. You walk to the door expecting to open it. But guess what, the door doesn't actually exist, you can't interact with it, so you just walk right through it.

Next you walk down a halfway to another door and, say it with me, you walk right through it. This is the last room of the game. There is a small room with a bed, a pole, a woman, and five floating ""toys"". You cannot interact with literally anything other than the toys or the woman, and trust me you can barely do anything with those either.

You can pick up each of the toys but they basically do nothing, and are incredibly glitchy. One of them randomly went flying off through the walls never to be seen again. You can touch the woman with the twos, she makes like one of 4 noises and her body moves up and down slightly.

That is LITERALLY it. There is nothing else. No interactions, no anything. The fact that this isn't free, and that worse yet there is DLC for this junk, goes to show that  this game is a scam and honestly should be removed from steam.",0,1678515279,10,0,1

The UI is very clunky, and makes actions harder than they should be. I've found myself trying to map a dedicated jump button. Climbing is a pain so I spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to climb out of a hole, because W is also jump. There is no double jump, or if there is it's really hard to hit because 9/10 space guy would rather slowly hover and sink like a deflated balloon rather than clearing the next block. 

The hotbar needs to be addressed immediately. There needs to be a lock option or something because once I select a block it moves it out of its space to be used, and a quick deselect will move it to the next available space. That can be another place on your hotbar or in your backpack. Not great in the middle of a fight and you're switching out weapons. God forbid you run over a new block and now you're stuck holding something you want that no longer fits in your pack. It's a pain point that has made me close out the game faster.

6189,1471910,"Let me start with the fact that I love CTC and I have bought and solve every single puzzle from all the apps they have released so far, except for this one.

I could be just me, but the clues for some of the puzzles make no sense... e.g. puzzle #26 hint #6 says that r3c2 is a naked single. Regardless how much I was trying to prove it that it actually is naked single, I never managed to. In puzzle #33 hint #2 says that in the 17 cage (the cage in boxes 7 and 8) cannot have 1, 2 or 9, which is correct, but the clue says that it MUST contain 4 while the cage still can be made with 3, 6 and 8 - again I completely failed to prove that the cage cannot contain at least one of the digits 3, 6 or 8.

If it is just me missing something obvious - I do apologise, but I have spend hours on some puzzles trying to prove the clue logically and failed to do so.

PS: I have allowed comments hoping that someone have spotted my error and will be able to explain to me how those 2 clues can be proven logically.

P-PS: I hope CTC will provide us with the option to give them feedback through the app so it will be easier for us to contact them.

P-P-PS: With the help of Cookie_Hunter I kinda managed to understand what's happening. My advice, do not rely on the clues. If yous tuck, just go do a different puzzle and late come back to this one as the clues might actually mess you up even more xD.",0,1609017041,3212,0,5

No achievements.

I don't like how a lot of sudoku games have way out of whack difficulty, to the point where, even if you know how to play sudoku, you're going to have to make guesses.

6201,1471910,"The excellent puzzles in this game are ruined by the numerous faults.

Game Design 101 - Have a ""New Game"" option in the menu. 

If a Player wants to repeat the entire game from scratch they should be able to.

Game Design 102 - Have a ""Save Game"" option. 

If you accidentally press ""Play"" instead of ""Continue"" from the menu, realise you clicked the wrong thing, and go back to the menu, the ""Continue"" option is no longer there. You can't get back to where you left off playing, unless you can remember the Puzzle Number you were up to.

This is virtually impossible, given that the Puzzles are not in numerical order.

Game Design 103 - Have the ""Reset Puzzle"" option on the same screen as the puzzle.

Why is this option on a different page?

 Cracking the Cryptic are on YouTube where the presenters solve a puzzle and you can try the same puzzle using their ""Net Based Software""

In that software, you can reset the puzzle from the same page. Why don't you have the same option in Killer Sudoku???

Game Design 104 - Have some consistency between your products.

Why is the web based software so different to the products you sell on line???

For example, why are there only 3 colours in Killer Sudoku, and 27 colours available in the Web based software.

Some puzzles on the Web are solved using colours. For example, you might know that various squares throughout the grid are ""89"" pairs, but you don't know which is the 8 and which is the 9. 

However, you can tell, that one 89 pair is different from another 89 pair, so you colour them differently.

Then at some point later in the puzzle, you realise that the 8 has to be Blue and the 9 has to be Red. So you can highlight all the Blue coloured squares with one click of the mouse; make sure the program is in ""Enter Number"" mode and click ""8"". All the Blue coloured squares will have 8 Entered.

You cannot do this in Killer Sudoku - WHY NOT !!!

Game Design 105 - Have a User Friendly interface.

The User Interface in this product and in all Cracking the Cryptic products, including the Web based ones is atrocious.

 It is User Unfriendly. It is ""CLUNKY"" !!!!

When I am using this product, or any other of Cracking the Cryptic product, I am continually making mistakes. This tells me the Interface is BAD. The program is getting in the way of my using it, instead of helping me use it; or making my usage of it effortless.

Just watch Simon and Mark on YouTube and see how many ""Entering"" mistakes they make when using THEIR own product. 

This is telling you their is a problem with the Interface. If the Interface was good, they would not make so many mistakes.

Game Design 106A - You cannot ""un-highlight"" highlighted squares.

You can do this on the web - why can't you do it in Killer Sudoku ?

This is especially tedious if you have to highlight many squares and you accidentally highlight a ""wrong"" square. Since you can't un-highlight, you are forced to ""start over""

Game Design 106B - Higlighting inconsistencies""

If I have highlighted certain squares, I should be able to select what I want to do with those squares, and shift between those options.

For example, I may want to Enter Pencil Marks in the highlighted squares, or I may want to Enter a Number in those squares, or may want to Colour those squares.

If I am in ""Enter a Number"" mode and decide I don't want to this mode, but I want to be in Colour mode; and I have highlighted squares throughout the Grid, I should be able to just press the Colour Button and have my highlighted squares coloured.

 This doesn't happen. I have to select the Colour Mode, then re-highlight the squares AGAIN

Game Design 107 - Have a decent Help section

The HELP in this product is ABYSMAL, and that is putting it mildly. It is absolutely ATROCIOUS. 

Every Computer Program, as part of its development, should be thoroughly tested before it is released. The testing will reveal errors and flaws, which the programmers should correct before the product is released. 

This has obviously NOT been done with Killer Sudoku - or else their Testers must have been retarded Chimpanzees !!!

The HELP system is hyper UNFRIENDLY !!!

You have to ""INTERPRET"" what the Help is trying to tell you BEFORE you start to work out and understand the logic.

The way of referencing Rows and Columns is confusing at best. A far more logical system would be to use a Coordinate system like they do in Chess, where the Rows are Letters of the Alphabet and the Columns are numbered. 

Knight (N) to F3, Queen (Q) to B4, etc.

I found I was continually looking at the wrong squares when using the so-called HELP in this program.

When they are talking about squares in a Column they give the Row reference first. If you are talking about a Column reference, you give the Column number FIRST, then the ROW

Column 4. Rows 6,7 and 8. NOT Row 6, 7 and 8, Column 4

It makes more sense to reference BOXES or CAGES then ROWS and COLUMNS.

For example, if you want to reference Column 4, Rows 7, 8 and 9 and this happens to be a 6 CAGE, why not simply reference this as ""The 6 CAGE in BOX 8"". That is far easier to understand then R7R8R9-C6.

If this happens to not be a CAGE, then simply say ""Column 6 in Box 8"" OR ""Box 8, Column 6""

Separate the sentences. Start each sentence on a new line. This makes it far easier to read.

It is absolutely riddled with errors of all descriptions - misspelled words, referencing Columns when they mean Rows (and visa versa), giving the wrong Column or Row, mistakes in Logic, Clues given in the wrong order, etc, etc, etc

This so-called HELP is littered with unhelpful ERRORS.

I must mention a definite POSITIVE in this game and that is the Calculator. This is an extremely useful tool and the programmer should be commended for this aspect of the game.


SIMON and MARK:

I commend you for bringing outstanding puzzles to the attention of the Public. 
I commend you for having the nous to make a Business out of what you love.

People pay good money (which they have worked hard to earn) to buy your products. 

Have a bit of Pride and Integrity in what you make and give your Customers a decent product instead something which is clearly substandard.

PS: 
My background is in Science and in Computer Programming, so I know what I am talking about. 

There was a Sudoku program I bought about 20 years ago on the NET and its User Interface runs rings around your products.

Solving the coronavirus pandemic would be a doddle for some of these compilers. I literally sat back in my chair open mouthed when I first opened Sam Cappleman-Lynes’ creation (No 38). 

For the record, I have completed all 40. But I have to admit that No 39 took a mountain of scribbled notes and a fair bit of chasing hunches. And it still took me over 27 hours. One day I hope someone can show me the trick I missed.

6251,1471910,"An excellent set of puzzles. Seventeen hours in, thirty-eight of the initial forty solved.  I'm happy so say without using any hints so I can't comment on how useful they might or might not be.  Two to go and I'm looking forward to the other puzzles when added.

There is so much variety here and so many clever ideas in the setting.  Almost every puzzle is a memory to keep rather than, as in most places, instantly forgettable.  Much beauty of constuction I've not seen in other Killer apps or software where algorithms can churn out almost infinite numbers of very similar puzzles.

The only drawback is that I've not had time to look at the CTC Discord archive or even all the CTC videos and puzzle links which I highly recommend - especially if you can't afford to pay a fiver for the app!  Which I can't really but couldn't resist temptation.  It would also be good to have more colours in the apps and have them as easy to use as with the CTC ""click the link under the video"" software.

6274,1472010,"Black Lilies - Eternal Summer is a visual novel about a group of friends who are trapped in a time loop of their summer vacation. I was interested in it because it takes place more than a decade after the loops began, which is different from a lot of time loop stories.

Because the game was made almost entirely by one person, the presentation is pretty basic - each character sprite has a few poses but only one outfit, and there are very few CGs. The music is fine but nothing special. I did like the map where you could choose what you did each day, but I'm pretty sure that until the third section you actually have to do all of the things anyway so it creates a sort of illusion of choice. I noticed quite a few typos in the text, but no real bugs or glitches.

The story was fine - I actually really liked the second chapter - but it drags on way too long with the main character doing variations on the same thing over and over. I liked the main character Alice a lot. That sort of brave, determined heroine is one of my favourite types of main character in a VN. That being said, most of the other characters are extremely tropey and change personalities quickly for the sake of the plot. All of the romances felt tacked-on and weird, especially after the way the characters had acted in the first chapter. (For example there is one character who grew extremely abusive during the loops and once she's changed her mind it's all kind of swept under the rug, and the 'villain' character does a complete 180 near the end).

This game does have some cool original ideas and a great main character, but it definitely needed some paring down and it can be annoying how much it gets so caught up in boring anime tropes. I could only recommend it if you really really like time loop stories.",0,1609048192,496,0,117

可改进：

6300,1471270,"As far as early access goes, this is a good game to buy, and [b]I recommend it if the goal is to support the development of a game that has great potential[/b].

[b]For a general game recommendation, it is a weak no[/b], and that's what this review reflects. It isn't very balanced yet, and a lot of things are a bit buggy and inconvenient.

This review will be updated to a ""yes"" once it's updated to a point where whether or not it is in early access is irrelevant when answering the question: ""Is it possible to have a lot of satisfying fun in this game?""

The game has a lot of interesting mechanics, and the combat is enjoyable through frustrating (it seems difficult to counter the undead at this point). It has an interesting way of revealing gameplay mechanics, such as death.

There is a lot of ""flavour"" that hopefully will be built upon, and several little puzzle type of minigames/explorations.

There's mention of island defence/base building, but the actual cannon mentioned isn't buildable or obtainable, which was confusing.

Melee combat seems very unpolished, but I haven't so far seen anywhere it's a genuine problem, beyond feeling tacked on rather than a core aspect of the game.

Several fun collection quests are lacking rewards at the moment, and that makes it hard to invest in what would otherwise be a fun kind of side-activity when you're bored fighting pirates.

I found navigation very frustrating on one of the key islands in the game, but that may be due to an aversion to reading sign posts.

Lockpicking can be tedious, and I worry it might not be very accessible for some groups of players - maybe there will be a feature to simplify this for accessibility (in settings, for instance, off by default), closer to launch.

I'm looking forward to updating this review after the next major update, and hope this will end up in the territory of Pirates of the Caribbean (the glorious old video game) in 2D.

It would be interesting to introduce ""trade"" at some point as well, but currently the game seems geared towards pirate combat and exploration, which aren't bad things.

A little edit given this game is compared to Faster than Light - I don't see that at all, and this game is [i]much[/i] more forgiving than FTL was/is. But that may be because I've played a lot of ""roguelite"" kind of games over the years, including pirate themed ones such as Sid Meier's Pirates and the aforementioned PotC game.",0,1722161889,418,117,27

Seablip has SO much potential, but as of the writing of this review, this is a very incomplete game. It feels a solid 50% done. The lone Dev does an amazing job at whats here, but I feel like they put in too many things to start so could not finish any, having their attention spread so thinly across the game. I would have much preferred less elements to the game if it meant that they were completed. Then other elements could have been thrown into updates as they were finished.

Treasure hunting, fishing, farming, crafting, mining, shell collecting, ship battles, upgrades, talk of upgrading the home island.... none of these things are in a complete state, but they're all here.

There is a 1-way story line, but if you don't follow it, the game carries on without you. (This happened to me when I missed a time sensitive event at the beginning of the game. The game carried on without me but I seem to have lost the story line entirely.) 

There are no tutorials, which made battling the first time a frustration. I needed to close the game and read a Steam user's guide (thank you!!) to understand what to do.

All the systems - leveling, crew, ships etc seem pretty well thought out. I do wish you could command people to stand on specific tiles to avoid poison damage though.

I love this game franchise with an undying passion and I would not be so harsh on the game if it weren't a sequel to a gem but this is a 500% DIVINE BALL DROP.  I am aware that this is still in ""early access"" but that can't excuse the lack of many of the former crucial features from the first game that have been lost. It appears the modern plague of *game look good so it good* and visuals coming first before gameplay has befallen this game. I pray the early access actually means that a bunch of significant things will still be added but I will list some things I like and dislike. Yes I do like some things in this game but much of it just enrages me.

Lets start positive:

Item upgrade: The item upgrade rework is pretty good, it can use some tweaking but its a good idea to add finesse to how items work. The options are a bit limited but its a good idea and refreshes the power meter by adding some new quirks that can boost its performance in unique ways.

Better database: There is a better database that gives more info on everything as well as a short lore explanation which is nice, useful since it added a lot more variants. Additionally there are now tokens for variants and attachments in the database which is useful and a good idea to give attachments and variants a bigger role.

Class evolution: Perks and class attributes are things you could select at the start of a game in Syn 1 and those would be added upon by this very well if they were still around. Class evolution presents the unique idea that you can obtain new class attributes and not just some module you can choose from the start, could use some tweaking ofc but its also a great idea that helps to add finesse and intuitive complication.

Matchmaking: if it works great, its useful and prolly suffers from no one playing for i wonder why.

The meh:

Bosses: Syn 1 never had amazing bosses and this game doesn't either, they are a bit better in that they function a better more uniquely and look nicer but that is about it.

The new weak point System: There are now weak points on most enemies but the main issue comes with the look of the game which i will discuss later but basically its very damn hard to hit these weak points cause it almost impossible to see them sometimes, otherwise a great idea to make dealing with non humanoid entities more fun, if you ever find those weak points.

More variants: The addition of more weapon variants is nice especially since many more have been added to work with specific builds and classes, there are some slight problems though mainly due to that many are not that useful, worse than the original game. Many many are very niche and are not that game changing and the original game changing ones had a lot of their original nuance removed.

The abysmal dogshit:

Lack of customization:  In the first game, I loved that you could customize a lot of fucking things. Like a lot. How the game looks, the controls, the graphics, the perks, drop rates, power tokens, difficulty, modifiers, etc etc etc, and it was all intuitive... BUT HERE that's all gone, well 95% of it, they added the customization of starting weapon which is nice but overshadowed, difficulty options ""I miss perfect reloads"" GONE now we just have some really bland ""escalation percent"", separate drop rate modifiers and power tokens nah combine them into only 2 tokens and remove the decreased drop rate options, class modules? who needs em get em out of here, modifiers are different but the old ones are gone, most are just: more damage, or less damage taken. I don't care too much about daily module power but it would still be nice to have them and be able to boost ones performance. The graphics are big qualm because it want to turn a lot of the crap they added of so I can see what is happening but the most I can do is just kill motion blur, ""WHY EVEN HAVE THAT IN A TOP DOWN SHOOTER?"". My head hurts from how streamlined the game is.

The Aesthetics: God did they butcher the art style, look how they massacred my boy.  You could say this is a personal qualm, maybe but something was lost, the personality of the game is gone with this new 3d art style. I know they still could have preserved the original style while making it look better, it is just easier to have these janky animated 3d models that are smooth and not sharp. I really miss how the first game, especially later stages felt dangerous like the military bay. First game we were ascending the kadai tower to stop Armageddon, here we are fucking wherever  doing total machine death in the streets. Yeah we fucking fighting in the woods for some reason or some garden idk ""I fucking hate how enemies can shoot throw the bushes"". The original artstyle had a very sharp look, militaristic, and dangerous you felt that you were fighting an unwinnable battle just from the artsyle alone. You could tell what enemy you were looking at based on their silhouette alone and defined coloration, here its just what the fuck am i shooting at and where. Sometimes you get an idea but especially with all the god damn screen effects its impossible at times even with minimal action. Since you can not turn many of the fx off you have to deal with static randomly appearing and most egregiously kills blurring the screen for a second, WHY??? just shake it a bit at most, if you insist you have these visual effects, please give us an option to turn them off like the first game which even with all effects turned on was incredibly readable, even when you were an a-10 vulcan canon as the heavy gunner. The guns also do not look as sharp nor as futuristic, why do we have a normal ass revolver in the game? that is just grey like the boring cheap desperate arena weapons you are meant to throw away? You do not feel like you are fighting machinedom that is governed by its own gods with these non colorful bland weapons. The items, my god they also are very bland, not just in what they do most of the time but in also how they look, WOW they butchered high command from looking like some sinister black comm with a red aura to a fucking boring mustard colored walkie talkie. Attachments also got a ""smoother appearance"" losing that sharpness, same with the body upgrades. additionally, why turn the camera 45% but have the map not be perpendicular with it, you could tell where you were covered in the first game, much harder here. The maps can look pretty and the visually animated stuff can be nice but often i would prefer being able to see the enemies clearly than have some gloomy atmosphere, night vision maybe? Also the gore is a lot less, when you finish a big fight if you ever do one, in this game there is not a massive mess, at most a few small stains and ragdolls you can launch into space unlike the first game where the floor would be covered in robot blood and the spent shell casing are everywhere. The music, if it is not taken from the first game, also sucks it just is some background nice that is high pitch and hummy, unlike the sharp abrasiveness of much of the first games music, especially the military bay music stomps this soundtrack to bits. One last qualm I have is that, why add humans, isn't humanity on the brink of extinction by machinedoms hand and you are zir's most patriotic soldier fighting to save the legion? Why have a fucking woman at the store in the middle of a level, when all machines have the order to enact total human death? It just makes no sense. The character perks you can buy also are just, really bland most of the time, none of the have that contrast needed to stick out and be remembered instead of being just a blur of shapes. The animations, bad, often they are janky, no synced, and everything is very clunky, running backwards looks atrocious and the turning animation looks like your dude is about to shit himself l. The chests and stores are fine but could use more variety

""As we are getting slowly towards the 1.0 version""

August 2, 2024
U17 Engineering
Keynotes:
Early next year
The Engineer Class
Boss / Gameplay Improvements
and more...

After U17 we are intending to go quickly towards launch""

Devs just punted release another year really quietly at the end of an update when they haven't implemented (Engineer LOL) or straight up cut (goodbye factions) stuff from the original road map (linked). But they have tons of time to implement stuff like Chat AI for NPC's. Or megascans. Or AI art. Oh yeah, and they will only patch their previous game Synthetik: Legion Rising after Synthetik 2 goes out. Expect all the quality updates for S2 that Synthetik 1: Legion Rising got, with the devs consistently blaming Game Maker for S1's remaining problems (it's a wonder how any of these games are even working https://steamdb.info/tech/Engine/GameMaker/), just like how the the devs consistently trash Unity on reddit for S2's problems. And god help the console players, either those with the existing game or those waiting for the new game....

Just save your money and see how this game is for release and post release. You're not missing anything by waiting. The updates have been extremely far apart, with major bugs (saving broken, new features like in game progress of finding guns broken), performance issues, and networking issues persisting for months because the cadence for updates and bug fixes is measured in quarters, not weeks. 

There is a core good game in here, but it doesn't seem like the devs are interested in getting there and would rather blame the existing engine for any problems and work on cool technologies to help them with their next game which will probably be in another engine. Not hard to guess with all the UNREAL complaining about Unity.",0,1722629238,3182,0,2
6317,1471410,"80 hours on the first game here
buy this one, crispier and more skill expressive.
The only thing the first one has over this is the speed, but thats about it.

For the actual review:
Synthetik 2 did gunplay in roguelikes better than anyone else on the market, I'd argue even better than some FPS shooters in the genre. A lot of it lies in the design decision that emphasize the impact of each of your shot. You don't even have to wonder if your shots hit, not when your screen flashes and the sound of the bullet shredding synthetic craniums resonates in your headphones. 
And that's not even all of it. Since the system is so complex yet intuitive, each kill you scored and each skirmish you survived won't take just aim and maneuver, but careful planning and the full utilization of your arsenal. You earned every thing you have achieved in this game, and you feel like it.

Now buy it so the devs buff raider's knife.",1,1721102721,1275,4,13

The game is early in development, but the developer makes a new update every or almost every week.

The game is already fun, kind of weird the way upgrades work, but you get used to it.

The game is similar to Nova Drift, but with a leveling and upgrading somewhat similar but different, a Twin-Stick Shooter movement and shooting mechanic, a Side-Scrolling Shooter way to make enemies appear, the white and black shooting and absorbing mechanics of Ikaruga, and bugs instead of spaceships.

It's not as polished as Nova Drift (that game is hyper polished) yet, but polished enough to sincerely have fun.

I think the game is worthy of his full price.

The money can then be used to buy items to decorate the main scene.
The graphics are colourful and the characters are funny and cute.

Besides the HO scenes there are lots of mini puzzles which are enjoyable and not hard to solve.
There are 2 modes to play, Relaxed or Timed.

6350,1471521,"Buyer beware!!

There is lots of information missing for how this DLC works that isn't reflected on the store page nor in existing reviews.

This DLC will completely modify the OMSI application, even after you uncheck loading this DLC in the Steam library settings. You will also need to register an account to use the minimap, even if you don't use online features. There is absolutely no indication on the store page this is required. Additionally, it requires administrator access to run this DLC each time you begin a game. At this point, it acts more like a trainer rather than a typical DLC for a Steam game.

It gets worse:

Upon beginning the game, keyboard functions become messed up on your entire computer for a random amount of time, making multi-tasking while playing the game nearly impossible, and use of Discord, Steam, and other third-party overlays unusable.

The minimap is not integrated to the game, but instead a window. This would not be a problem if it the window was not poorly designed and did not interfere with gameplay. There is a greatly increased risk of DirectX failures. This already high risk is almost guaranteed while configuring mini-map settings, or streaming the game.

I had to uncheck this DLC from being loaded in the Steam library settings, but now, OMSI behaves as if it's still installed, always asking me to run it in administrator mode for the sake of the minimap. Since installing this DLC, the already mediocre-performance game now gives my computer heavy lag spikes every several seconds while playing the game, even outside of the game. This can be seen in the performance tab of Windows Task Manager. For reference on how bad the severe lag spikes that occur on my computer since installing this DLC, I use a Ryzen 7 3700X,

To summarize the many major problems with this DLC:
[olist]
    [*]Requires an account to be registered - email address required
    [*]Permanently modifies OMSI 2, even after unloading the DLC
    [*]Behaves more like a trainer instead of a typical DLC - requires admin permissions
    [*]Ability to multitasking and use keyboard and greatly hindered
    [*]Greatly increases the risk of DirectX failures, interrupting your gameplay
    [*]Results in overall computer having severe stutters, even with high end hardware and after uninstalling the DLC

I originally bought this several years ago straight from the PeDePe website. While a very simple app, it has all the options that you could want quite honestly, with various features to adjust the window to your whim. 

When it first came to Steam I was highly disappointed that it was part of a package that included online and company running mechanics. I didn't want all that, so to see it now as a separate product is good stuff.

With the release of the London DLC, content that I have literally been waiting four years for since playing the original South London Project mod, I have gotten back into Omsi 2 and picked this up. Having app updates as well as new maps added automatically will be a nice QoL touch over the non-Steam version, and you can still add new maps at any time.

Good stuff, so glad to see it as a standalone product.

The game used to run poorly, but the dev fixed that quite a bit and now it's mostly fine.

The PLC-as-currency thing is a little bit ""Hey guys, can you tell that I played Lisa?""  The EP Snails (is that what they are?) are at least slightly altered while clearly being an Earthbound reference.

Oh, right, this is a positive review.  Uh . . . great supporting cast.  Good mobs.  Mostly good bosses.  Mostly good tracks.  The structure seems pretty clever, and I don't just mean the precious shortcut right at the start.  The business with the Present seems like an interesting thing that I completely botched for this playthrough because I went too far on the southeast, but that itself represents something of a mechanical twist.  I still don't know where the guards went . . .

I also need to give credit for the tutorial boss featuring a very solid double curveball.  I was worried from the first twist that you were going to just retrace the steps of a certain other RPG, but the second swerve cleared things right up for me.

Me giving this a positive rating is slightly bullshitting to encourage the dev, but that's really only because it runs like it does.  This seems like it may end up being an excellent alt-rpg, albeit undeservedly obscure, much in the same vein as Endless Empty or something like that.

6396,1470720,"Pretty good.

I've yet to finish Misery Street, but after my +20h of playtime I can already tell that the dialogues are clever and have a good sense of humor that has resonated with me. The game has the right balance between taking itself seriously -but not too seriously. Not too goofy and not too edgy.

Combat-wise it's fine. Nothing groundbreaking, as you would expect, but fresh enough, and several memorable fights would make up for it. Same goes for the soundtrack.

I should mention that there still are performance problems in big areas where the fps drop, but the developer is aware of it and keeps updating the game to this day.

If you're considering buying it, I'd say go ahead; you do get a lot out of the current price.",1,1693965025,1535,0,73
6397,1470720,"I tried writing this review 2 times already, but somehow it ended up deleting itself both times. Third time's the charm I guess!

To start off, I had this game reccommended to me when I was looking for turn-based RPGs, especially those inspired by Earthbound in a similar style to Undertale, that were made by Slavic game devs, and this is exactly what I was looking for.

There are a couple of critiques I'd like to get out of the way first. At times the music can be a little bit of a hit or miss, bigger areas can get somewhat laggy and the fights can get repetitive, but none of those are enough to make this game less enjoyable to play.

At times it gets pretty edgy, and the mature themes of this game are inseparable from the setting, story and game mechanics, but I even with how dark it is thematically, I am having a lot of fun with it. NPCs are interesting to talk to, the story is intriguing and I can't wait to see what it ends up leading to, and the party members have what I find to be a really nice growing relationship. There are so many good moments that hit hard emotionally because of their tragic, shocking or unexpected nature that I will probably think about even long after my first playthrough. I also enjoy the puzzles present in the game - it is a lot of pushing boxes but also just exciting to figure out.

I feel like I am experiencing Earthbound for the first time again and at the same time as if I am playing an edgier version of Undertale, both of which are some of my all-time favourite games. A great experience overall and if you liked any of the previously mentioned games, Off or Omori, I'd say you'll probably also enjoy this one",1,1659515870,1882,0,3

6400,1470720,"I felt like leaving a short review, as there are so few of them for such a criminally overlooked game.  Misery Street is a classic JRPG style game with an aesthetic that is fondly reminiscent of old computer games.  The story deals with various existential ideas like the meaning of life and coping with the indifference of the universe.  The main story was pretty entertaining, but what really got me invested was the various people you meet along the way.  The citizens of Misery Street also struggle to find the meaning of life, and the answers they settle on range from humorous to downright depressing.

The gameplay is simple and satisfying, both in combat and the overworld.  The combat is turn-based, and each of the characters utilizes different equipment and resources that makes them play distinctly from one another.  The exploration of the world rewards you with all kinds of goodies if you take the time to check everywhere and talk to everyone, and it was very satisfying.  Even after completing the game I still felt like there was so much more to find and do, which is great because the game also includes a new game plus of sorts.

The only real negative things I can say about the game aren't really bad, but really a matter of taste.  The humor really didn't do much for me, especially the part with the pink shrex burglar in the shower.  The final showdown, which for story reasons I don't wanna get into, I really didn't enjoy playing and was totally ready to just be done by the end of it.  

Misery Street hits a lot of check boxes for me, as it is fairly difficult, has a reasonable game length of about 20+ hours, rewards exploration, and is visually appealing to look at, especially the fantastic combat sprites.  This game was definitely a pleasure to play, and I hope the creators make another game like it in the future.",1,1692748594,1434,0,2

6412,1470750,"This game is garbage. I just bought it on sale because it was on my backburner of stupid purchases because of spellcasting Palpatine.

When you start this game, you immediately spawn in some castle ruins. You move with WASD... kind of. W makes you move forward as you would expect, but A and D don't make you move sideways or turn. Instead, you move forward while gradually turning left or right. This is the most ""Tank controls"" I have ever seen. S makes you duck. You can't move back. You can roll by pressing space, but annoyingly, it opens that weird box up there where you can change your language, I suppose? It doesn't really work, so I dunno... By pressing the left mouse button, you can attack with either your sword or your staff. You can somewhat control the camera by moving your mouse, if you swing it around on one side (hard to explain, it's just weird).

[URL=https://youtu.be/wuPo1lybkzk]Here's an attempt to showcase the awkward controls, [/URL]however, I can't really show how awkward it is to control the camera aside from me struggling, but that doesn't do it justice. It's way worse than it looks.

When you're in the castle, there's really nothing to see, just an empty map with two portals next to you. One leads to the PvP area and the other to the trap level.
In the PvP area, you can fight people, but first, there has to be more than one player, and that's obviously not going to happen unless you can convince your friends to play this nonsense.
The trap level is just an obstacle course with spikes and swinging axes. If you reach the end of it, you get 1 gold, which you can do nothing with. Also, the map resets, but that doesn't matter since you very likely won't have more than one player playing anyway. I also kept running up things I probably shouldn't be running up on, and obstacles sometimes killed me without touching them, I think. On a more positive side, rolling seems to work, and it's very effective when trying to clear the trap level.
Visually, it doesn't look too bad, but my window was really small, and I can't find a way to make it bigger. Also, the trap map has some issues that makes the game lag. In fact, you can see the same lag in the trailer. The camera, however, is horrible. I've already mentioned how awkward it is to control, but it's awful in general. It often clips into walls, making you unable to see anything.
After some time, the game consistently crashes for no reason. Also, pressing ESC opens some strange glitched inventory of some sorts. Dunno...
Don't buy this game. I bought it as a joke, and honestly, this game managed to avoid being boring-bad and it became funny-bad because of how much of a trainwreck it is.

College football is back and on PC. (Also has US pro and Canadian rulesets)

No play by play
No onside kick formation as of this review
Annoying Canuck play logo as a transition screen(I would rather have it just go to the gameplay or show stats)

The actual game play is so bad. It's not even good enough to make you want to jump in on games and get a result for your team. Perfect passes just fly through wide receivers etc.

The dynasty mode for me, could have saved the game from a bad review. I play a lot of sports management sims & so game play isn't the be all and end all for me. However, I just cannot get my head around how there isn't file sharing for this game. All the other sims i play have thriving communities of modders and it provides everything you'd want from the game. There is absolutely nothing for this game.

6420,1470790,"I like this game, I really do.  However, I do have some complaints.
1) The kicking game is not well thought out.
2) Whoever said this game is based on physics is way off base.  I don't know how many times my guy gets caught and tackled from behind and yet I can't catch up to a guy.  OR when I have a clear path to the QB by both LB he some is able to step out of the way and run the ball passed both guys and then he is able to find a hole and get passed my linemen for a gain of 10 or more yards.  So that doesn't make sense, especially when when I do a running play and I try to sidestep or speed burst and automatically get tackled.
3) Turnovers, especially fumbles are not consistent when a guy fumbles the ball, my guy can be standing over the ball and no matter what button I push I can't seem to pick up the ball and or fall on it. 
4) Trying to defend a pass, I have tried a lot of different ways to switch to a defender close to the ball to intercept the ball and each time I get a pass interference call.  So while I have thrown many interceptions, I have only had 1 by my defense. 

Overall though, I really like this game.  I still give it a strong 8/10.  The graphics are good, the game play is easy to pick up.  There are other aspects of this game that really make the purchase worth it.  Such as the recruitment of players, being able to edit players, and schools.  The downfalls listed above are not enough for me to stop playing the game or recommend you not to get this game.  Just honest opinions.

For this game to be made by small developers and not some big name company who shall not be named... This is a really good game.  So showing major props here, this is a good game.",1,1612654682,23070,0,3
6421,1470790,"To start off, I have this game of my ps4, but i really wanted to write a review so bought this game, just so people know that i'm not writing this with just .1 hours played. this game has potential, they are making a game that every sports fan wants, a college sim. but outside of recruiting and customization the game is rough. its a small team so for some things, its understandable and I personally can let it go. 


Pro:
- Recruiting, your basic ncaa 14 recruiting, doesn't really add anything new to recruiting but honestly thats fine, just the recruiting aspect is super fun
- tackling, while animations are rough (i'll talk about it later) i do enjoy that tackling seems to be a bit physics based and not totally scripted like madden. i can't 100% confirm this but from what i've played it seems that way. which if it is, i think its a plus.
-Customization, I personally am not one who likes to create my own team and logo. but they do give you the ability to create every real college school and even create your own logo which i'm sure people who are into that would really like.
-passing (kind of), one of my biggest problems with madden is how easy it is to intercept the football, this game is a bit more realistic in that even if a defender is a couple yards away, they won't be able to just jump in front of the receiver every time to intercept it. you are able to make a 15 yard throw were the ball goes over the linebacker and he isn't able to run back 10 yards from a dead stop in one second to make the interception.

Cons:
- Basically everything else about the game
- The controls, God awful. this needs to get fixed more than anything. and maybe its because i'm used to madden but idk who decided that sprint is going to be the A button (on controller) and the RT/LT are to juke left and right but the devs need to just take what madden has and implement it. they don't utilize the R stick at ALL which doesn't make any sense. its like they took a football game from 2003 and copied those controls (except when you're the qb and are throwing, it suddenly changes to RT. just stay that way). not only that but there is no tutorial or mini camp that lets you familiarize yourself with the controls. you can change controls, but it just won't make sense since they have specific buttons for juking/spinning left and juking/spinning right, if you change it you'll end up with an even more confusing control setup
- Graphics, not good, but this is a very small dev team so i can't exactly blame them for not having top tier graphics. they get a pass but bad graphics are bad graphics.
- rules/options, they really limit you on how you can change the game. you have the option of 15/10/7/5/3 minute Qtrs, just let us pick the quarter length. 15/10 minutes seems to long and 7< is short.
- player movement, it just feels like an early 2000s madden game, there is no fluidity to movement. players can stop and start running without really losing any momentum or speed. there is no weight to a player, again i understand with this being a small dev team, but i still have to point it out. and i can't confirm this next bit because i haven't played a game in a month, but when i did play i felt like in order to catch a ball if i jumped for it my player wouldn't go to the ball but instead jump straight up in order to catch it, so you would have to move your player to where the ball was going before the ball got there instead of being able to run and catch. I could be wrong about that but just from memory i believe that is the case
- Team name/Abbreviations, for some reason they decided to limit how long names can be for a school as well as limit how long abbreviations can be. like i get you don't want a school with 30 letters, but for schools like TCU you can't type in the whole school name, and abbreviations only go for 3 letters, so schools like UNLV and UCLA, you have to put a different abbreviation. doesn't make any sense to me.
- kicking, no clue how to kick. they tell you the controls to kick. but nowhere does it explain how kicking works, do you hold the left stick down a second and then push forward? do you quickly push down and then up? there is no power bar to tell you when you should push the left stick up. 
-fumble recovery, players will almost never attempt to run with the ball, 90% of the time they will fall to the ground to grab the ball even if there is nobody near them


Overall:
Its a good game if you enjoy the management aspect of sports games, nowhere near as in depth as football manager or OOTP, because it is a football game not a management game, but the gameplay is so challenging due to the confusing controls (which you can change but without the use of the R stick its still impossible to remember what each button does) and the clunky movement of players makes frustrating to play games. if they could fix those even a little it would be a much better game, even with the lower quality when it comes to the graphics.

- Play Creator. I loved it back in the day, and that'll never change. Unfortunately, you can't make your own formations (or at least in a way I could figure out).  
- Franchise in general is great. If you are getting this game purely as a Simulation game, it might be worth it but...

Cons:
- The Gameplay. Its painful. I know it is a small team, but receivers running away from the football when its thrown to them, being able to phase through defenders, limited running moves, constant snap glitches (had the ball fumbled because the RB ran in front of the ball before it reached the QB), etc. I loved creating plays, but as soon as you tried to run them the gameplay ruined it. I had to look up how to kick effectively. 
- Absolutely no presentation. Its been said, and will continue to be said. There are no announcers, which doesn't bother me that much as they can often be more annoying than entertaining, but there isn't much of anything. There are touchdown animations but they drag on too long with no way to skip (that I found). Otherwise its just the Canuk logo on loading screens. 
- Limited to no on the ball adjustments. On offense you can change the play, but no way to flip it or hot routes. On defense I couldn't find anyway to adjust. It seemed to be you pick a play and you're stuck with it, even if you see a glaring hole. 
- Poor graphics and animations. I went in expecting it, but its worth mentioning. The animations are janky and arms often glitch through their shoulder.       

Overall, I wanted a College Football game, and it delivers when simulating, but actually playing the game is not fun. I can't recommend it when half of it functions worse than 15 year old games.",0,1611197081,164,0,2

I love the customization of the teams, rosters and logos. You can literally create any league from H.S. to the Pros.  The game play could be better I will say and can be frustrating at times.  I've got used to the passing and running the ball is pretty fun.  This series had a lot going for it and i'm hoping the future (even with a new developing team) the game can only get better.  I love the Madden games but it needs a competitor to make it better.  They (EA) have been stagnant for years. I give credit to the small Independent studio on making a pretty good, but not perfect, yet still fun football game.

There is a lot of potential in this game.  In it's current state it can be fun, the editor is great and the team setup is cool and in dept.  The actual game-play wasn't as bad for me as some have mentioned, occasionally players would do something weird and I still don't know how to kick properly but it's fun and relaxing.

6444,1470790,"It really hard to recommend this as rough as it is. It's kind of hard to call it a football game as rough as it is.

Smoothing & Polish there is none.

Everything is extremely abrupt and rough. The animations the transitions. The menus. Nothing is polished nothing feels finished and nothing feels complete. Getting a TD feels like whiplash as it jump cuts to an endzone dance, at break neck speed. They should of spent less time on endzone dances and more time on collision boxes.Which is seems like they did. Instant replay's are a button press option given at random by the game. So if you want to watch that move or hit again. FORGET IT. Much less saving them. They've not yet offered me a replay on a play I actually wanted to see. Individual player stats are also given at random by the game. And only your teams basic stats and run pass breakdown are given in game.



Gameplay

Defense 
is awful really. Player movement pre snap is janky and weird for seemingly no reason. Player movement seems unstoppable once you start also for some unexplainable reason. I think it's that the A.I. takes over control the exact second you are no longer inputting something. Instead of when you switch to another player. Basic player audibles don't exist. Like pulling your LB out of a blitz and setting him in a zone. Or pulling a db out of man to cover a deep zone. Or putting them in press or off coverage. So you will not be micro managing and fine tuning your defense in this game.

There is one button to swat and catch balls. There are no swim moves spins or as far as I can tell bull rush. So there is no depth of play on defense at all. Hell there isn't even a shuffle/strafe button for tackling. Which along with a tackle, catch, and sprint would be the minimum. Which it doesn't meet. 


Offense
Is alright. Not great mind you. But like most things in the game feel less polished than games 10 years it's senior.Run game feels very lack luster. They should really note the subtle ways rumble can be used in game controllers. The problems being already noted collusion boxes. Lack of finer control of receiver routes in audibles. 


Kicking
Sub Par. Just about sums it up. No indicators for what's happening. And I mean at all. The base level of the kicks is pre set to a horrible angle. Aimed straight into the dirt. And once you've got the angle correct. You just slam the stick back and forth as fast as you can. Not that it tells you to do that either. I had to look it up in a video because I didn't fell like just trying random things until I figured it out. Which is I guess is what is expected. Oh wait they do have slowly disappearing yellow arrows that in no way accurately depicted what you should do.So it's worse than not telling you it tells you the wrong thing. 

Penalties
The penalty system is borked. Been flagged for a defender standing where the ball would be before the receiver and trying to catch the ball. And for delay because the game doesn't whistle at the 2 minute but after.


Play editor- logo creator - uniform editor

For the love of God I do not know why the play selector from the play editor is not the one used in game. Because it is a thousand times better, than going down each individual formation to get to the one you want. A gun wheel style menu, the one in the play editor,  break each page down by number of WR's but not the damn one they choose. It needs to be patched out it is that bad. And they have a better one that works, in the same game.

Okay. The editor itself is alright. No major problems. It is nice to be able to set the QB reads. So if you sim it you can know full well if your play works or you are making it work. You can test them. The slider for spotting the ball is simple and fast.

The logo editor  has a lot of options and could essentially be used to make anything. But is a bit of a pain to use. I find myself trying to do the same thing over and over. 

The uniform editor on the other  hand is a bit lacking. It's easy to use which is a plus. Yes all colors and tons of preset logos and the editor. But the amount is still lack compared with older games. There is one set of everything and you can pick the color. It'd be nice the same editor. Well maybe one with better UI. But if it could be used on the uniforms.


Bottom Line
When you aren't meeting standards set over 10 years ago in a video game. You are falling extremely short. If you want to support the game based on a desire to get anything that isn't a monopolized version of football. You could buy it. It it is not yet a complete game. Worthy of note for being anything other than a game not owned by political activist. And agenda driven people. That I know of atleast. But I can't recommend it on it's own merit. I do understand smaller Dev team. Less money. And all that. Which is why I came in with low expectations. But it is lacking in basic and simple things that have nothing to do with money. 

I really do hope they pull and these solid pieces together and keep building on what they have. Because really it isn't that far off from being a good game. But they really need to buckle down and set down a strong gameplay base. And smooth out those some of those edges or the support will die out.


This is a rough overview of the problems and complainants I cam up with for the game within a few hours. I really  fell it's enough to make your mind up on whether or not you'd want to buy it. I'll tack on the bit about whatever the franchise season mode is when I get around to it.

But really the bare bone minimum things this game needs to be okay and playable. And recommend as an okay football game.
1. Is use for the play selector from the play maker in games. 
2. Fix the defense movement problem/ A.I. problem or whatever it is, not stopping, change of direction. And the weird pre snap janky movement. So you really have control of your player on defense. 
3. And add strafe/shuffle into the game. There is no football without it. It's done all game. Before game. at practice. It's a must and make the game feel and function better. Even if you don't add the animations just a button that slows you down  to make tackles easier

You are looking for objects like any other HOG but this one has the added benefits of FMV scenes with puppets and a couple humans too. While Howdy, Jacob! looks cute at first glance, the story beneath is a little more sinister regarding the Laughsail television show you are casting a new Jacob for.

6478,1470920,"First things first it's worth your money. Buy it.

Beyond that my thoughts are as follows, minor spoilers ahead.

Positives first:
* The art is outstanding.
* The level of detail in the world is incredible, in both the art and text. There is a massive world here that I'm only getting a taste of and I want more. Sesame Propaganda St is a horrifyingly fantastic idea and it's clear the work has been done on the wider story that we only get a taste of.
* The cut scenes are all very well acted/written (by mostly puppets). They're equal parts funny, engaging and also often unsettling, like many of the smaller details about the totalitarian wold Laughsail exists in. 

Negatives:
* The puzzles, while caked in lore and detail, aren't much more than a click everything spree. However that may be the intentional, as they feel a little bit pointless...which is how living as a Jacob inside this world might feel (judging from the one living Jacob we meet)
* The length, it's short. I'd almost prefer a different format for the game that keeps the focus more on interacting with these puppets. I want to learn more about this world, and bring down the oppressive (I assume they're evil?) state. The limited amount of time I get with these characters was not enough. 

In summary Howdy,Jacob! is a small game in a massive universe that I hope is explored further. It's worth your time. And make sure you click on the ""Unhelpful"" hints as well as the ""helpful"" hints. They might be my favorite part of the game.",1,1608248736,61,0,1

On top of that game they pasted a weird story deliverd through a wall of text at the begining, that doesn't make any sense, isn't interesting to read, and doesn't mix well with the hidden object game at all either. On top of that they added small FMV sequences where someone either ad-libs for a couple painful minutes or painstakingly states the objectives for the next H.O level.

Not much frustration with finding the objects, but there were a few annoyances like the list of objects taking up room on the play area, so you have to minimize it and keep referencing, and a few times where the object name was really vague and there were multiple matching items in the scene.

The gameplay explanation is pretty simple: it's an hour long Hidden Object game with some very colorful vaguely surreal scenes. On that front, it's fine, a bit short, but fine.

On the ""What actually makes this game interesting"" front, there's this overarching lore involving this TV show you're allegedly shooting which is implied to be some kind of totalitarian state Muppets. There's a lot of lore both in the scenes and between the scenes regarding whats going on, but honestly a lot of the FMV acting felt, I dunno, lacking confidence? I remember doing a video production class in high school where we'd do skits, and we'd all be kind of vaguely embarrassed at being silly, and when you watched the video you could tell we weren't like, fully bought it with our acting. It reminds me of that, where even the developers of the game weren't fully bought into the concept, and a lot of the lore is just kind of ends up being ""this whole concept sure is unusual right guys haha"".

I think on average, I don't regret playing the game, the whole experience in general just felt off, and not exactly right. Based on the art, maybe that's what they were going for anyways.",1,1645380777,60,0,58

[hr][/hr]
Okay, so this game definitely has a charm to it. The concept of a children's puppet show used as propaganda in a regime is really cool. However, I don't feel like the writers really committed to this idea. 

The writing during the cut-scenes is either serviceable or bad, with only a few really good lines. The puzzles in the game have great art. Also the music is very pleasant. Sometimes I would stay in a level for an extra minute or so just to listen to the soundtrack more. I enjoyed getting to explore each ""environment"" even if some of the hidden items are hidden that well do to a difference in image resolution. I still enjoyed looking for all the wacky items on the list, except [spoiler] Level 8[/spoiler]. Screw that level with items being invisible until you randomly click on an empty place and poof the item was there. Furthermore, during the cut-scenes there is a very visible artifact from having a green screen, not a huge deal on it's own, but stacked with all the other rough edges well...

Overall I think this is a cool experience for 30-40 mins, though ultimately I wish there was more exploration into this worlds setting and did more than be a hidden items game. I'd love to play a game like [url=store.steampowered.com/app/1147550/Not_For_Broadcast/] Not For Broadcast [/url] with these characters.

The music was actually really great! Reminded me a lot of Phantasy Star Yamaha synth. Wasn't expecting it tbh.

Pros: Pretty fun visual design along the lines of PS1/N64, good music, challenging. Also plenty of control customization. Unexpectedly fun cinematic camerawork in some of the cut scenes, etc.
Cons: A little buggy, and gameplay's a little rough around the edges, but that's to be expected with smaller indie development. Part of the charm really.

I think if I had played the first 2 episodes, I would have had more of an onboarding process in terms of understanding how the game's mechanics work. Recharging the ammo was lost on me because I thought it was charging to shoot a more powerful bullet, so I basically played on hard mode the entire time throwing rocks at bosses lol.

This game isn't going to blow you away, but I think there are some super interesting mechanics and gameplay going on that could be expanded on later.

Took me about 30-45 minutes to ""get"" the game, and understand what it's trying to do, and then flew through it pretty quick after that and enjoyed it a bit more. Some fun effects if you eat the wrong food in desperation lol. Very cool detail.

Unfortunately that also means I can't speak to just how different this is, but on a quick review of my past reviews, I can say that this game features no ruins to speak of, instead opting for a wild, untamed planet of vicious raptors, plants, bugs, and pterosaurs. Much like the prior games there's some hidden collectibles for folks after some secrets, and a survival mode which, presumably, serves as a more difficult mode for those seeking more of a challenge.

Admittedly I mainly enjoy these games as short, fairly easy single-playthroughs, so I haven't replayed the first two for either the collectibles or more of a challenge, but I may at some point, and appreciate the replayability they both offer with those elements.

Oh, and I should say, if you're hesitant to pick this up thinking perhaps you need to be clued into the story from the past two games, don't worry about that. These work well enough as stand-alone stories, so you can hop in at whichever point you feel like. Want a good little adventure on a dinosaur planet instead of delving into some ruins? Jump right in with this one! If you like it well enough, the rest are similar, solid, & affordable enough that you won't go wrong!",1,1657608717,70,0,66

6551,1470970,"GraviFire is an interesting twist on block-pushing puzzlers, but its lack of undo is an absolute dealbreaker.

The game's easy levels are irrelevant and forgettable, and the challenging ones often aren't fun because you can't try stuff out due to the flabbergasting lack of undo, combined with instant restart upon hitting obstacles like lasers. This gets genuinely frustrating in the later, bigger levels. Besides, the player character's movement speed is really slow, which is fine if you're solving the level for the first time but also gets frustrating when you're trying to re-tread known ground.

Not every game needs undo; but this at least requires a design with no fail states. For instance, SNIKS didn't suffer as much from its lack of undo. Needless to say, GraviFire does not fulfill this requirement.

The final 10-ish levels are more difficult than the earlier ones, but mostly by way of being huge, which is a very disappointing way of doing so T_T. There was even one level where I reached the final section, only to realize I'd have to either solve this section entirely mentally, or beat the level via ""corpse runs"" and restarting over and over; or I could look up the solution. I did that for a few levels which didn't look intrinsically difficult, just infuriating to solve without undo.

The level progression is terrible. It's a linear progression, i.e. you only ever unlock one new level, combined with a hacky ""skip level"" button (which has a limited number of uses and doesn't recharge). To make matters worse, that ""skip level"" button treats the level as beaten, so if you want to eventually beat all levels yourself, you have to manually remember which levels you've skipped?_? Plus manually navigating between levels is a pain which requires 5+ button clicks.

If this game had an undo feature, including undo past level reset, I might have recommended it. As-is? Not a chance.",0,1664995862,110,0,222

1. This is an 8 directional shooter, however there is no way to shoot in any direction while standing still except for the way you are facing.

2. The dash......... the per pus  of dashing is to avoid enemy's and or help cross jumping gaps. In this game that does not apply, you are unable to dash in the direction of the enemy if the enemy is within the dash distance, So with that said dashing through an enemy to avoid damage is not possible. As for air dashing I did not even try. 

3. There is no way to change video setting such as full screen, boarder-less, window ect...

4. There are no Audio options.
I am sorry to leave such a bad review on a game that seems to have been made by one or a small group of people, since I to a working on making a game myself. Even though it is Obvious that assets were bought for this game i was hoping that effort was made on the game play its self, this is not the case at all. You would have more fun watching the grass grow or paint dry. I give this game a 3/10 and that is being very generous true rating for this game is a 1/10 .

I very much hope that the developer of this game reads my review and fixes the issues i have laid out with this game, should that happen this game would be at least a good time killer and worth about $10, but until then this game is not even worth .99 cents. I have submitted for a refund.",0,1610380872,41,0,40
6564,1470220,"I picked up this game because it puts together elements from so many other games I've played in the past.  When I was younger I had written a small game in Visual Basic similar to this about managing a movie theater: Buying movies, keeping snack bar stocked up, managing personnel, advertising etc.

But this game goes beyond all that incorporating elements from “The Movies” or maybe more accurately the BBS door game “Movie Mogul” (producing your own movies) and of course the fact that it visually looks like Sim Tower is kind of nice as well.

I’ve only played for a short while so this review isn’t comprehensive but first impressions are good.  As with any business management game it’s slow and repetitive which some people don’t care for and sometimes I don’t care for it either but sometimes it’s exactly what I need.

One technical improvement that could be made is to have the game window (when in windowed mode with CTRL+Enter) be resizable.  I normally have my PC set up with three screens but using a driver that let’s Windows see it as all one wide screen.  Also there are monitors that are “ultra-wide”.  By default the game is full screen taking the full width and the top & bottom of the display is cut off if it’s too wide.  You can easily go into and out of windowed mode but the window is the same size as the game was when full screen and the window is not resizable.  I was able to get going by disabling my driver but other people who have one ultra-wide monitor may have an issue with this unless this is fixed.

Also note that the min. requirements says Windows 10 but I am running it fine on Windows 7.

There aren't a lot of gamers that like business management games but if you do then this one is definitely worth checking out.

6565,1470220,"So you have a building and in it you have some theatres, advertising, food delivery etc. and you build up your company.

You can upgrade your theatres for example seating, projectors, screens and snack bar, order in food and drink for the theatres, order in new release movies or classic movies to serve as a filler, make your own movies, plan out a release schedule and more and it is really simple to do all of those steps and don't forget to collect the money laying around.

Those who live in Australia where it is DD/MM/YYYY instead of MM/DD/YYYY may get confused and order a movie several months away from where you need a movie to screen and I have done that a couple of times, I do wish that there was a board where you could slot in movies that you want showing in your theatres so you can easily work out your film showing plans. 

The big downside to the game for me is that I believe the game is too slow, the days pass by too slowly so if you want a quick game, you're not going to get far but other than that I believe that the game is a good diversion of time.",1,1656029102,56,0,55

It has a lot of the game play elements I was looking for- ""Write"", cast and produce films based on actor and director stats/ set, effects and costumes cost and release to fanfare or flop. This game definitely has that, although the movie production aspect of it takes a lot longer than I'd like.
The time between productions is spent upgrading your theatres to be able to charge more for tickets, and managing releases and advertisers as well as keeping the food supplies for the various concessions stocked.
As you progress through the days, more parts of the business unlock. The game play loop is quite addictive.

I do wish there was a x3 speed to make things just a little bit faster. And the graphics leave a lot to be desired when played on desktop, but might look just fine on a small screen like a Steam Deck.

Although you are standing still you literally feel like you are staggering sometimes and seem to feel the movement of the ship underfoot when watching the waves.

The controls are pretty generic across all vessels at the moment and the developer has stated that this is to be addressed soon and once this is implemented it will level up the already great realism and ‘being there’ feel dramatically.

The dev has implemented a mini world  with various islands from different regions of the globe which is a great idea the islands are within 5-10 mins sailing distance of each other which feels about the right balance in terms of the game.

One thing missing from a lot of ship simulators is an economic model and that is present here, oldies like me will fondly remember the old dos & Amiga game ‘Ports of Call’ and many have wished for a 3d game which emulated that old classic, this game does that, but even better… it’s in VR :)

Hopefully the future will bring success for the game and even more features like buoyed channels, damage & repair, AI traffic, ice floes, rope physics etc. I do wonder if ‘Powerboat’ label will see the game overlooked by the ship sim community I hope not as it has a lot to offer and build upon and a hardworking and committed dev who has already released many updates and has great plans for the game’s future development.",1,1643304523,433,0,7

""Paper Tales"" is definitely in my top 3 drafting board games and I jumped out of my seat when by pure chance I discovered there was a recently released digital implementation of it on Steam !

But then ""Oh no...""
Just by looking at the screenshots on the store my excitement went down really fast.
It's a barebones (I don't like using the word ""lazy"" when talking video game making because the true culprit is usually time and/or money given from the publisher) direct smarthphone port.
So yeah the game is played on a small vertical window and there's no options at all to change that. This single but very important detail takes the whole enjoyement downward.
It feels super cramped up and makes everything hard to read.

The game is only 4,99€. So at least the price is fair and tells you you shouldn't expect much.

Graphics:
Scenes are nice and look decent, but a max resolution of 1500* is ""suboptimal"" to say the  least. Not adequate for todays times.

Sounds
Finally the girl has ""some"" moaning sounds, but sadly they are still bland, not fitting or very enticing. This is probably my biggest problem with an adult oriented game and needs to be addressed asap

UI
Interface is still terrible although minor improvement-changes have been made.

Gameplay
Walking speed is TOO SLOW, especially for a game that in its entirety is a walk left, back right, back left all the way over the map.. and back again...

Puzzles
Mostly fetch puzzles but overall they didnt come across annoying. Simple but lovely.

Story
Sadly this is another big letdown.
WH 1 had a believable story, grounded and fun with a sweet girl as protagonist that just got unlucky to find herself in a haunted house. WH 2 goes way to much into supernatural over the top unrealistic territory to be fun, believable or immersive.

I find this game, on the obtuse side, It is a mechanical improvement for sure. 

Story wise there are many things that are not that clear, or simply not explained. (at last compared to the first game).

6626,1470310,"Overall this is a great entry into the Witch series. The artwork and CG's are great and there are a lot. The story is relatively nice but mainly the big draw for this game is the atmosphere. The game does feel rather linear and a bit annoying as your walking speed is very very slow and there is no option to go faster. Sometimes it can feel confusing on where to go especially since some of what you need is in the boss rooms. If you are going for everything the game will take you roughly 4-5 hours including the DLC. Overall I recommend this game for its visuals, atmosphere and the CG's that are present. It may feel a bit expensive but at the same time, there isn't much else like this on Steam.

Primarily M on F, horror (little to no gore), tentacle, anal, cum, BDSM.

Cons:
- The walking speed is horrendously slow artificially lengthening the game
- Collectathon 

Suggestions:
- it would be nice to fast forward the CG's that are videos

6640,1470320,"I think, with a lot of detail work this might be a decent game.  I also think that graphics department here is brilliant because this looks way cooler than it is.  Problem is the basic game is a fairly basic supply line type game.  but with roads instead of conveyor belts.  And the peasants are to stupid to know where they are going with anything so you can't have a road go more than one place.  *sigh*  So, conveyor belts called roads.  And yes, later, with knowledge derived from ancient dwarven ruins in the third mission, you can have a road that peasants will choose the proper direction at a fork.
I want to take an aside here and not that Steam Powered Game's proprietary spell checker does not know the word ""dwarven.""
It's not the core game play that brings this thing down to the ""not recommend"" status.  It's a bunch of little things that add up to it being frustrating.  And that's really it.  It's not hard or requiring any gret skill at the point I bailed.  It was just annoyingly frustrating.  
As mentioned, the roads make no  sense.  With that comes the weird nature of what needs a road.  Houses and farms and stores do not need roads but ore does.  *shrug*  I think this was originally a factory game and somewhere along the line they changed their minds about the setting but not the game.  I can also say that, a good way to NOT endear a game is to have an NPC constantly insult the player.  Not the NPC you are listening talk to the other NPC, who's insulting the player.  He's insulting YOU.  I get he's a *spoilers... not* bad guy.  But seriously.  Not they way guys.
Do not get me started about how poorly the documentation is.  Buildings do not bother to mention inputs they require.  Some logical.  Some... huh?  And when something goes wrong the have a little exclamation point above them letting you know that... checking the building to find out the problem... ah there is a ""production error.""  That is the listed problem.  Building has all the materials it needs.  At capacity.  It was working a minute ago.  But now, ""production error.""  No idea why.  And this stuff happens over and over.
But, the thing that got me to essentially rage quit was the bloody game telling me ""you have to many of this building"" and thus, not letting me build another one of it anywhere on the level.  If this were a puzzle game I'd say, okay.  That works.  But this is not a puzzle game.  And this was not the tutorial level as far as I could tell.  No limits were hinted at.  No number or totals listed.  Just suddenly, no more of this building for no particular reason!  And it's the second building in a three part production chain.   WTF?!!??!!?!  Not a good look for a factory type game in disguise as a mid-evil city builder game with floating islands for spaces.  
In short, I got my three bucks out of it.  I bought it on sale.   I can't really recommend YOU spending three bucks on this.  But certainly do not pay full price.  At least not till they iron out a lot of this (smurf).  I'm a short putt from nuts.  If you are a bit more of a dive then get it on sale.  Or buy something you will like.

It didn't but not because it's lacking quality.

In it's essence (and as far as I've played), this is as much a puzzle game as it is a building sim. You play missions (there's an open end mode too) and have to achieve goals in them. To achieve these missions, you need to build certain structures while keeping in mind rules for logistics among the different building types.

You need, for example, a specific minimum amount of workers to man your buildings. Workers live in houses, which need to be in a two field radius around a farm. Clay pits and mines need one or more building to refine their goods, so roads need to be build between all of these and the buildings that use them. And so on and so forth.

Often you'll find yourself scrapping buildings or roads that you either don't need anymore, or to correct an error you made. Most tiles or building can yield additional harvest using a clicker mechanic, allowing you to restart broken logistics cycles after you fixed it, removing harsh penalties and allowing for experimentation.",1,1609788084,88,0,34

It's puzzles are well thought out and will require a bit of work to get right, they aren't too simple but also not designed to make you jump though a hundred hoops for a small hint, the devs of Malmyr found a great balance when designing the puzzles.

Lastly one of the things I love the most about Malmyr is the option to go into first person and explore the world you helped to build, walking through the town and discovering all the little notes and easter eggs scattered throughout the levels for those who explore.

First off the trailer made me think there wold be more platforming in this game, it's very barebones it's a stealth-puzzle game, which is fine I like that. I liked the first world a lot - the challenge was appropriate to the length of the levels and it was interesting collecting the coins. The second and third worlds really should have had some checkpoints on the longer levels because it gets VERY annoying retraversing and redoing the puzzles back to where you lost, like up to 2 minutes of some levels time (you lose the instant you get spotted or hit an enemy) and the puzzles while usually not too difficult have a lot of moving parts so it's not just time you also have to pay attention to that. In addition it introduces one enemy (a boar) which is a bit of a reflex challenge, it's still a puzzle but you have to be very precise. But there were some good levels in it. The third world was just annoying. Again mostly long levels - even longer than the second world. Then it introduces an enemy (without any kind of tutorial) that is almost entirely reflex-based. It's a bird that you have to lead in one direction then avoid (usually jumping over or crossing in the other direction if possible) so it will continue off screen, but not too soon or it will change direction. I could never work out how to do those consistently so any levels with those were a dice toss for the attempt. This was ok during the levels where it's in the beginning, but some were toward the end. Then towards the end of the world it introduces a new mechanic - a search light. No tutorial no introduction. Everything I tried I failed. I had to look up a guide and what you have to do is way too difficult to manage with a controller, or probably keyboard too because you have to do very minute movements yet can't take time either. The 4th world was a remix of the first world levels with some added elements from the 2nd world in them - I liked it a lot and it's nice to have shorter levels again. So should you get it? I don't know the good parts are pretty fun or at least allright, the bad parts are terrible. And this features no kind of non-linear level design - if you can't beat a level that's it you can't finish the game which you know is a problem especially considering everything else. But as I said I guess for most of the playtime I didn't hate the game and some levels were indeed fun.

Oh, and one really weird bug. So there's challenge rooms (which are timed things to collect I didn't find them interesting) that you get for collecting all the coins in the world. Except there's one extra coin in each world and if you get one more than the max the rooms won't unlock and you're screwed.

Anyone who plays the game should be aware of one thing: Every possible interaction, no matter how small, could be needed again later. So play very carefully and don't miss anything.

[u] Here's The Thing:[/u]
Picking up where the first left you stranded, once again assuming the role of Saki alongside her recent former lover Sen on-board the cursed train. What initially should have been a swift and painless exit takes a turn for the worse… As both fresh exes are pulled into their most feared nightmarish detour; a SEQUEL~

Though not a terrible product by any means, it is a letdown when you go into this [i]after having played the first Re:Turn[/i]. Although I compared and contrasted Re:Turn 2 extensively with the OG, I also reviewed it in its own merit...[/code]


[h1][u][+] PROS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:)  ENJOY YOUR STAY-TION~[/h1]
Technically, you could go into this sequel blind as it will recap the main events of the first game anyway. But it is still most advisable to play that beforehand so as to build a sense of urgency, attachment to the characters and suspense over what could happen next.

For the most part, gameplay has been drastically shifted to make the survival horror portion more present- transparent whereas previously it was more outlying and scripted. With things like watching your stamina meter, a dodge maneuver and more interactivity with the environment! But it will feel like a déjà vu especially when you run into the puzzles, more on that later.

At about 3 hours in length, spanning eight chapters and but one ending (there may well be two) to be arrived at. Being priced at one-third cheaper than the first, I’d say it is done rightly so since it’s much briefer~

[h1]TIPS:[/h1]
1) Keep on getting killed? Simply go into any of the carriages’ individual rooms when chased.


[h1]:)  UNRES-TRAINED IN APPEARANCE![/h1] 
The presentation is without a doubt, the part where they pulled out all the stops for! With graphics being much sharply detailed, atmosphere richly immersive and the darkness more waywardly insufferable. All of which you have the brand-new engine to thank! Even the dynamic stills, which were already quite breathtaking are now even more ""cutscene-like"" to witness.

Yes, a significant number of locations were reused, or rather I should say recycled and repurposed. But they are just as lovely, if not more so. Think of the “Corpse Party” treatment where iconic areas get remastered. Aside from the addition of voiceovers, which were more than decent to say the least. Sound design-wise, there isn’t much to point out being almost identically consistent~


[h1]:)  NO RUNNING AWAY FROM FATE.[/h1]
I was arrested by [b]One Way Trip’s[/b] big boy thematic on letting go, new beginnings and too soon goodbyes. That sentiment only gets intensified in [b]Runaway[/b] and paralleled by the noticeably drearier surroundings. But this time- posing the question and begging for a ""do-over"" to the way things were… 

It handles that maturity in such a way that it’s dignified further, and not softening the emotional impact or sacrifices of the original. But unfortunately, that’s where the good come to an end… As you will find, it has been directed off the tracks so to speak, since for how long? Who knows when~


[h1][u][-] CONS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:(  A SAKI WAY TO GO-[/h1]
Re:Turn 2 is pretty much the same as its predecessor except more inferior in gameplay with more out-of-place mechanics than you could count. Remember the red herring that is “Sen’s pendant” which has clairvoyant properties? Well bid farewell to that. 

The sudden incorporation of a stamina bar had no other purpose besides serving only to match the now more chase-oriented, enemy roaming formula. The UV-lens and dodge feature were casually inserted in hopes of adding some substance and misdirection to the already baseless idea for a sequel~


[h1]:(  SEN YOU INTO AN ANEURYSM…[/h1]
The ordeal becomes even trying when you take into account the puzzle logic… or lack thereof more like. This is a tangent, but what is it with horror games nowadays prioritizing and then becoming straight up brain teasers that completely detract from the point to begin with- a.k.a. to frighten and induce repulsion!? 

Returning to the topic, the puzzles didn’t help its case in the past and it surely won’t in this one… I swear, one of the chapters is just one big unwanted “throwback” to the heavy backtracking that for some reason the developers decided players couldn’t live without!

Worse, there were an incessant number of occasions where the clue that an item should be used were either poorly phrased or just inconveniently left out. So, say that you do get stuck- nine times out of ten, you would already have the key item on you! I only wish I was exaggerating. At one point you just learn to go with it and hop onto the ignorance~

The plot is a hot mess and completely unnecessary. For one, it undermines the serious tone that the original set. And it felt so utterly cheap in inception like it’s obviously done just so there’d be a new entry in the series. Of all the directions, they could have gone with one- they chose the most cheesy and unoriginal. Steamrolling deaths to evoke drama? That’s a new low! And the amount of explanation to something so mysterious spells out everything… Well, make way for the exposition express!

The voice acting is pretty darn good, but they tend to bring out the worst of the amateurish writing and make what once were likeable traits into whiny remarks. Half the time, the dialogue either took me out of the situation or the other, had me scoffing away at how they could be said with a straight face. With lines meant more for neutral, inner thoughts becoming dry observations... I’m convinced the development team secretly had a reshuffling of staff~

[h1]:(  SCHEDULED FOR DOOM![/h1]
Always at the back of my mind were the words “why” and “what just happened”. The former being an outcry for, once again, the rationale behind this sequel. I cannot make my peace with it… Like why expand, and thereby ruin an ambiguous ending to a relationship that had run its course? 

The latter is more a result of the pacing, as to why it went back and forth in timelines? If you recall, the OG did that too but Saki was contextualized as part of it and so essentially reliving it. And by the time the credits dropped, I recalled my exact words were “…okay so that was three hours of leading ultimately to the same conclusion as before I started Re:Turn2”.


[h1]BUGS:[/h1]
x The inventory menu has a habit of unpausing the game but still appearing in the foreground of your exploration.


[h1]NITPICKS:[/h1]
~ Text says “I should get to the other side” even though you’re already well across…
~ Option to toggle off the button reminders so they don’t ruin the screenshots! 
~ So “much” blood. Not many!


[h1]""PLEASE BE THE LAST STOP~""[/h1]

[u]Last Words?[/u]
I don’t see or get the point of the sequel, even if it runs me over. A watered-down rehash of a perfect conclusion! New cosmetics, voiceovers are cool; but like Saki, trainwreck couldn’t be saved~

If you liked [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/1195360/] Re:Turn One Way Trip[/url], then you should probably steer clear of this sequel which just couldn’t leave good things well alone. Everything you loved about the OG either gets shortened, deteriorated or repeated. And the ones you could do without make unwelcome, ghastly returns~

4-5AM I saw it get released and bought it. The first version had game breaking bugs on intel and nvidia gpus but it later got patched and fixed. As for the game itself I had a blast! I really loved the secret locations of the Pages, the atmosphere  and the way the puzzles worked but I have to say some of them are stupid to figure out (But i guess that also depends in your Brain lol).

And it has 8 chapters and voice acting, and it also is even a survival horror game in some places. Definitely a step up from Re Turn 1, and I think it's definitely worth playing. But one thing... Lock puzzles return in this game, so good luck solving them, as they're pretty tricky. But there's a problem. For some reason, the game crashes sometimes when dialogues and cutscenes should play. It's a problem. It would be better if the developers could fix that so the game would be at its best.",1,1643426133,575,0,55
6664,1470420,"Just finished my play-through of this over on my Youtube channel - link at the end of the review for anyone who wants to see a sample of gameplay before buying. As always, here are some thoughts on the game...

Re:Turn 2 - Runaway is the sequel to Re:Turn - One Way Trip, and picks up the story where its predecessor left off. Our protagonist Saki finds she is still trapped by the demonic forces of the lost train, and cannot escape until she has faced them. Problem is, her fiance Sen is going crazy and there are ghouls afoot. Cue a short journey as Saki works out what she has to do in order to free the train and its surroundings of the evil afflicting it...

Re:Turn 2 is definitely shorter overall than Re:Turn - One Way Trip; whereas the latter had 10 chapters, the former only has 8 (some of which are not that long). I think this was a good decision on the devs' part, as one minor complaint I did have with the original game was that a couple of the later chapters started to drag a bit.

In terms of visuals and sound design, Re:Turn 2 is much the same as the original Re:Turn - a combination of colourful, RPG Maker-style pixel graphics with a grim, dark overtone and decent sound design to help set up a bit of creepy atmosphere. As with the first game, the devs have done fine in those regards.

Where Re:Turn 2 is notably different, however, is in the inclusion of some new game mechanics that were not present in the original Re:Turn. As with the first game, at it's core it's still a 2D side-scrolling game where you wander around and explore the environment, finding clues and items and solving puzzles in order to progress. However, there are a couple of notable, new additions. Most notably, in some levels there are now monsters you have to worry about - these will wander back and forth and will chase Saki if they spot her. To counteract these, there are three further additions: firstly the sprint now has a stamina bar, secondly you can press space at just the right time to perform a dodge if a monster is too close, and thirdly there are now also hiding spots where Saki can stay out of sight (assuming the monster hasn't already seen her enter said spots).

Personally, I thought the addition of monsters helped to freshen up the gameplay a bit - there's still a fair bit of backtracking involved as there was in the first game (i.e. having to wander back and forth in each level as you figure out what you need to do to progress), but now having to contend with the occasional monster helps to make things a little bit more interesting. Fortunately, not every level contains enemies - so there are some chapters where you can relax between moments of tension.

As for characters and story, I did enjoy the game in these regards. It was also quite interesting to learn a bit more about Ayumi, the antagonist who we first met but didn't really explore in the first game. There are also two endings you can find - I only found one of them, but I got the more heartwarming ending, so I'm happy with that.

I'll also say a few things about the setting. The first Re:Turn all took place on the lost, derelict train I mentioned earlier. Whilst this is also the key setting for Re:Turn 2, I was also glad that the devs didn't limit themselves to this; various chapters in the game involve exploring outside the train as well, finding and exploring locations such as a creepy cabin in the woods nearby and a frightening, prison-like spirit realm. Just helps to add a bit of variation to the setting!

Were there any criticisms I had of Re:Turn 2? A couple, though these were minor. Much like the original Re:Turn, Re:Turn 2 does have the occasional part where the constant backtracking to re-examine everything, find new clues/items/puzzles etc, might not be to every player's taste. Also, as was sometimes the case in the original, there was the odd puzzle where I needed to look at a walkthrough for the solution because the way the player is meant to solve certain brainteasers was mystifying. However, despite these gripes I did still enjoy this game overall.

In summary, I thought Re:Turn 2 was a decent sequel to Re:Turn - One Way Trip, and I would definitely recommend it (though I'd stress that you ought to play the original Re:Turn first, since this game continues the story set up there)!

Selling it separately made me think we were getting something new (not a new story, but like the gameplay or some twists in the story to bring more ideas). The concept just stayed the same? and it was much shorter, with no real build up. I did think the sound effects were great, and the voice acting was good, but other than just being an end to the main story there was no point of the game. (no questions answered that we didnt already know)

If anyone wants a good example of what I kind of expected with the newer game it would be The Coma games. The first one is good but the second game was better because it built off the story, introduced new game play, and a new environment. This game however just made me wonder why I need to know any of this information.

6667,1470420,"This is bad. So bad. So many ways bad. 

I loved the first one Re Turn one way trip. Go play that. Ignore this one.

The writing is awful. I don't want to spoil but i'm feeling an air of pretentious blah along side a feeling of adding darth vader yelling 'noooooo!' That bad. 
The gameplay mechanics are lazy and awful. Brute force items on all spots and there's numbers all over... GG done. 
The ""puzzles"" are awful. 
It's half the time and I got lost because I couldnt care to focus.
Actually it's a bonus that it's shorter because I did not want to spend any more time on this.
There was legitimately nothing told in this game that made it worth existing or knowing. With the reused assets and very dead existence of actual gameplay. It's sadly feeling milked. 
I'll add one specifically unnecessary mean moment towards the end as another negative. There was no reason for it other than.... just cheap effort to exploit emotions but you see it coming from the start so it's just annoying and cheap and serves no purpose. 

The artwork is nice.
Most of the voice acting is enjoyable. Some of it very much so.
The credits music is very nice.

That is not enough to carry the rest of being awful and uninspired.

I wanted to like this so much up to the very end. I really was so hype for it with how much i enjoyed the first one. How into all the character development the first one had. How fun the writing of the first one was. The variation of the first one. Much smoother gameplay. More interesting in every single way.",0,1646736019,275,0,8
6668,1470420,"Let's just start with the good stuff to get it out of the way. There are a lot of improvements with this title compared to the first one, having played the series back-to-back it was more recognizable to me. For example, more polished character portraits, voice acting, creepier atmosphere, better audio confinement (like the rain and train), pop-out colours, and with some brilliantly done animated CGs that got me on my toes.

Not everything is perfect though like adding stamina which I didn’t feel was needed in this game as it made it a lot easy to get caught by the monster unless you know where the hiding spot is, plus you’ll need to be twice as ahead of the creature chasing you so it doesn't see where you’re hiding. Unlike this game, the mechanic of cat hunting mouse was better implicated and balanced in games like Coma 2 and Worse than Death. The other issue I thought I just mentioned was not being able to progress after completing chapter 1, stuck with a black screen, but that happen during the launch week and the developer sorted it quite quickly, so there’s not much to talk about it now. 

Now, the big elephant in the room on why I can't recommend this game is the story or rather the ending (big spoiler ahead). [spoiler]Resetting everything[/spoiler] that happens in this game and the last just made the hours I committed to this game pointless, the whole[spoiler] time-travelling solution [/spoiler] all just came out of nowhere. I can understand the developer not wanting to commit the [spoiler]deaths[/spoiler] that occurred in the first game, but they could have written it better like[spoiler] resurrecting the characters [/spoiler], and still have them feel the consequences of what happened.

Both games show that Red Ego has a lot of potential as a studio, especially in this character-driven style of story telling. The main weaknesses that these games have is how the first one draws to a conclusion and some of the script writing for the second one. I did feel that the main antagonist is not as clearly revealed as such in the first game as the intro to Runaway implies and the start to this game's story didn't have the same draw into it that the start of the first one did.

6695,1469610,"Great all around, except for the combat imo. 

First off, the main point of the game, which is resource management. You control a train, and have several different resources such as fuel, food, ammo, people, and things like metal for upgrades. The whole resource management part of this game is very simple yet very engaging. Send your soldiers out for supply runs as your train powers across the country side on a gorgeous overworld map. This section is a little reminiscent of The Wandering Village visually, which I really enjoy. Although, the part where this game starts to shine is its harsh choices. Can you spare food to a war-orphaned child, or do you keep it for your men as your limited supplies dwindle? A bit like more depressing games such as This War of Mine. Most of the time though, making the ""good guy choice"" isn't actually that costly, and so there isn't much incentive to be a bastard constantly even on the harder difficulties.

The part I dislike about this game is the other half of it. The combat. Its simple and straight forward, which is fine, but the game acts as if you're able to conduct grand strategies that could rival a general. You cannot. Put your guys behind cover and hope they hit their targets. Its fine, and admittedly satisfying, but its SO costly in ammo and medical supplies that you are forced to use stealth a majority of the time, which sucks. And yet, they base so much of the game around it. The stealth in this game reminds me of old flash games, as you literally spend maybe 90 percent of it avoiding HUGE enemy vision cones. Your options include sneaking (which makes you move silently but does not conceal you at all even behind cover), throwing a rock to distract a guy (which is what I spend a majority of the time doing), and using binoculars to see beyond your vision cone. The only thing that really counts as stealth in this game is the fact you can hide in bushes. Every single combat encounter I get into, I groan, roll my eyes, and consider closing this game. If they had ONE more stealth feature, the ability to hide undetected behind cover, I would seriously consider this game a masterpiece. I know this seems like such an odd reason to stop short of giving this game that title, but if you try the combat for yourself, you'll see what I mean. Imagine playing Metal Gear Solid and Solid Snake cant crouch, lie down, hide behind cover, or use any stealth gadgets but the game still focuses HEAVILY on stealth, because thats how this feels. I would argue that maybe 10 of my total hours have literally been cheesing the shitty stealth systems in this game. 

All in all, this game is VERY solid. A definite 8/10. If you can look past my one complaint, its wonderful and beautiful. It deserves at least a try from anyone who gives it a passing glance.",1,1721547515,912,0,27

Once I got to Moscow right at the start of the game I realised how basic the ""strategy"" was going to be.

I enjoy squad based, strategy games etc. This one is quite simple, which is fine. What isn't though, is the lack of proper cover and line of sight mechanics. You can literally be crouched behind a wood crate, or behind a stone wall and enemies will spot you. This totally ruins any stealth or strategy you might want to implement in your play style. I couldn't even set up ambushes since the enemy will move towards you and once their POV cone reaches your (not) hiding troops they become alert and start firing.

Apparently bushes completely conceal your soldiers though... Ridiculous for a so called strategy. If the lack of proper stealth play existed I would 100% recommend this. But without it I refunded since I can't play how I want and more importantly how you should be able to.",0,1721048929,203,0,49

I thought at some point I would have to make the decision between doing something like shooting a civilian or letting him notify the reds but no... not only is it morally black and white but you're always rewarded for doing the right decision with more resources.

The system with the downed soldiers works very nice and deserves praise for how it encourages you to play through a failstate instead of just save scumming. However the resource caches encouraged me wipe the reds off every map which made the missions somewhat tedious. Also the snipe ability was way too powerful and the flanking in the game was often done with an obvious bridge to repair or a gate to unlock.

pros:
- Great and interesting setting I never heard about before (when a game makes me read wikipedia articles that's a plus)
- A good combination of mechanics: I really like the idea of the combinarion of army management and rts battles

cons:
- The two main parts could've used some work which results in a middling experience
- RTS: This plays like a combination of Company of Heroes and Shadow Tactics without the strengths of either concept. In theory, you could have epic battles with lots of soldiers at the same time, but you cannot access buildings and since every soldier counts, that is often far to risky. Also there is the possibility to use tanks in some missions, but they die far to easy to machine gun fire so the balance is off.
On the other hand there is the sneak approach using snipers, looking out for watch cones and coordinatings stealth kills. But then you use only 10% of your army (snipers) and nothing else.
- When it comes to army management there are a lot of QoL features missing: Why can't you unequip all soldiers? A lot of the time is spent clicking notifications away and adding/removing soldiers to certain tasks. That would be fine, but for some mechanics it just does not make sense. Also in the end the difficulty got too easy for me and I could just rush along without taking any sidequests. maybe a harder difficulty would've helped.
- Mechanics like hiding from airplanes in a mission are more egregious than fun.
- After a mission you have to manually send your soldiers around to pick up any resources.
- There are also some minor bugs, but nothing game breaking.

All in all I am sad to give a negative review, because in general the game fits an amazing niche and there is a lot of potential to be a great game, but unfortunately that is not used to its full content.

6703,1469610,"This game somehow made me a Czechoslovakian patriot and I knew very little them beforehand.

What an experience. The faults in gameplay is made up by its story and characters and overall ambiance which brings it up to an overall enjoyable experience.
This game borrows a lot of mechanics from games I enjoy; though many of them are not fully fleshed out, there was still plenty to enjoy. Being someone into history, this game taught me lot about a real historic event that happened that I did not know about beforehand and I'm so glad I got to learn about it through this game. 
The combat is a pretty familiar real time strategy game, feeling like Iron Harvest, but greatly watered down.
The logistics is very reminiscent of Frostpunk.

To get into the details, the game is divided into these two parts, the combat missions and the train logistics.

The combat missions are easily the game's weakpoint, mainly because of enemy AI. The enemy AI are completely braindead and leads to a lot of cheesable moments. Stealth mechanics end up making the game feel a little silly, rather than the serious tone they were going for. The map designs were overall pretty good and definitely rewarded the player for exploring every single nook and cranny and felt like looking for little easter eggs hidden around. The main criticism of the map design is how predictable most missions are. Almost all missions play like this. There is this hard mission to accomplish, but there's this side mission you can do that makes your main mission much easier. (Finding weapons or allies or a secret path) It kind of took me out of the immersion just knowing that I'm mindlessly beating the missions exactly as the mapmaker intended, rather than really figuring things out on my own. The missions can get repetitive, but most missions to have a slight twist to make them a little bit unique to keep me interested enough to beat them.

The logistics part of the game definitely had potential as it had a lot of what made Frostpunk great, in fact there's a very similar cold element as you need to keep your soldiers warm. There was also just something so badass about the overall premise of maintaining your little train as you make a run towards the finish line. This premise is what really sucked me into the game and I wish this part was more fleshed out as well. Locations that you visit on the map become quickly repetitive. Although there are some unique encounters you can come across, most of the time it's just boring resource collection. 
A lot of the upgrades on the trains are boring and don't really make much sense. They're just not exciting. The choices of train cars also feel very limited. There are only 3 engines to choose from for the entire game, which really surprised me. Many roles and cars were just straight useless like the kitchen with chefs, which I though would be essential in a game like this, but turned out to be completely useless.

The character upgrades and getting to know them, I had a bit of feeling of Valkyria Chronicles, and had similar progression trees for each character. Many of the higher level abilities indeed felt pretty fun to play with and I loved the mechanic of rewarding special soldiers after battles, definitely made battles feel more personalized. Each single soldier has unique traits and even their own bio making each of them unique in a way. My only wish would be for them to be more fleshed out like Valkyria Chronicles with at the very least an epilogue on what happened to each soldier, which we never get.

The story and characters are what really drive this game. The relationship between you and your associate Captain Langer is interesting especially with live action scenes where you can actually see him. As a fan of history, knowing that this is based on actual events is very interesting as I not only learn about the Czech legion, but also the Russian civil war.

Overall this game attempts a lot of things. They're not very fleshed out on any of them, but the combination of its parts along with the overall premise bring this game into a much more enjoyable sum.",1,1722847867,4177,4177,14

6735,1469800,"Koma is a confusing, both in a bad and a good way.

First the game seems to have some optimisation issues. Even on my Ryzen 9 XT and Nvidia 2800 Super, I had some lags and micro freezes, usually when loading a new area.
Also, sometimes I felt some issues regarding of the usual rules of game design in the way to indicate you the path. Combined with the fact that you can glitch the camera trough the walls, and sometimes yourself, it result in situations where you don't know exactly what you're supposed to do or where to go. I completly understant the goal to make you feel lost in this strange world and I like that, but sometimes I just felt lost because of confusing game design. It reminded me it was a game and kinda breaked the illusion.

Wich is a shame because when the game managed to guide you from scene to scene, it's a very immersive experience. The narration threw the lights and sound design can be really intense, fascinating and disturbing.
In those moment, this game feels like discovering the craziest digital art instalation, but huge and free of the physical rules.
For those who know the work of 404.zero, it's really like discovering on of their piece, but with unlimited budget and the ability of beding space.

In addition to the super original mechanics, the challenges are very well thought out and very diverse. Each world has 20 levels, I'm on the third one yet and I haven't got sick of the game yet, which is common for me in short puzzle games. I need to repeat that this game is really fun. I was very happy with this game. The development time was longer than expected and now we know why. It seems that nothing here was done in a hurry, everything was very well thought out and executed. I would like to do this review after turning the game around, but there are really many phases. No stage is repetitive, the diversity of this game is incredible, even without being so diverse in terms of graphics.

Fiquei muito feliz com esse jogo. O tempo de desenvolvimento foi maior que o esperado e agora sabemos o porquê. Parece que nada aqui foi feito as pressas, tudo muito bem pensado e executado. Gostaria de fazer esse review após virar o jogo, mas são realmente muitas fases. Nenhuma fase é repetitiva, é incrível a diversidade desse jogo, mesmo sem ser tão diversificado em termos gráficos.

6751,1470030,"Ok, so there's only one real reason I would not recommend this game and that is because, I think it needs a little bit of polishing up for the price it is, it isn't much but I enjoyed the game for the most part. It just kind of devolved into more frustration. 

So to start off, the premise of the game is simple and the design is simple too, Buffy is fantastically sinister. I love the look of the game. I think there is a sensitivity modification missing with the options as I had a bit of difficulty with my sensitivity of looking around. 

I will also add that the sound elements of the game are pretty great, though it can be a little jarring when some sounds loop over. The cues to know where he is was super well done and you could easily work out the proximity and, for the most part, could tell whether he was above or below you. 

Where I find faults with the game is the AI of Buffy, I assume after a certain amount of time, he has to leave where you are if he can't get you but this time seems to take a ridiculous length of time, at some points. I've stood for minutes waiting for him to leave. When he wouldn't I had to try and do something to push the game onward to move on leading to death, most of the time. The high places you can get on to be safe from Buffy seem to have issues sometimes with Buffy spawning into the master bedroom bed at times, either getting stuck or immediately killing you. There were a few pathfinding issues too, with the AI, from what I've noticed.

For the price, it wasn't an awful game. But would I recommend it? No, not unless it was in early ages. I did play this in a stream as I wanted to play a new horror game (Link is here for anyone interested: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/842211046).

I managed to finish the game on original game difficulty in less than 10 hours (14 hours to get all the achievements). The game is just like the original Commandos 3 but remastered in HD, with one minor bug that I found so far (medkits doesn't heal as intended - if you are wounded and you pick them up it heals you automatically for very low amount of HP) and some very rare crashes when using the quick load button but they doesn't break the game save so it's just all about restarting the game and you are fine. No censorship on the WW2 symbols (atleast in my country).

[i] If Dark Souls was completely fuckin clapped and had a retarded cousin [/i]

Had this on my wishlist for a while now as it gives off the vibe that it's a pretty chill fkn cat simulator where you just do cat stuff and shit you know?
Got a notification on my phone.. EARLY ACCESS HAS BEEN RELEASED.. I was like FUCK YES LADS proper gassed up and shit finally I can play a cat simulation game (even though I'm more of a dog person but ya know whatever) 
So I launch this up and kinda laughed at the UI looking like it was made in paint or something.
The music made me wanna kill myself, jesus christ its horrific. 
So I jumped into some of the 'Cat run' modes and what on gods green earth were they thinking. You're a cat right (as expected) but you just move side to side and do some shit it's so slow and if you a bit ADHD like yours truly it gets super boring very quickly - this goes for all cat run modes. I kinda liked the cat flap one sorta like a B-tec flappy birds or something lmao
Anyway.. for the REAL reason I bought the game.. FARM SURVIVAL LADS LESSS GO

Holy motherfucking dickballs what the fuck. Firstly, I can run Cyberpunk 2077 on high settings at a consistent 50-60 frames.. this on Ultra was at about 30-35 fps with very frequent lag spikes. Dropped down to high and it was the same as Cyberpunk, 50-60fps. Secondly, the mouse sensitivity is completely clapped mate I swear to god I whacked that shit up full speed and nahhh I was moving like a snail could barely look about took me about 30 minutes just to turn round, my nan knits quicker than the camera speed. This desperately needs fixing.
Thirdly, the animations are pretty retarded I mean words can't even describe how fucked the animations are.
Can't even kill a chicken - this game is literally more difficult than Dark Souls and I am not even joking. You try and smack a chicken fucker and it just straight up molests you. The chicks? Nope not a chance.
Some dogs don't give a fuck about your presence.. but the FUCKING PUG I SWEAR TO GOD IS A BEAST AND WILL ATTACK YOU ON SITE!!!!! PUG IS A TWAT!! 
Giant fucking rats three times bigger than you??? Yeah this shit scared the hell out of me.

Basically if you want a retarded ass game which has aids controls and barely works.. fuck it go for the cop its only 2 quid or whatever but I recommend going and getting a can of beer or a pringles can or something..

6786,1469220,"Yes. 

The game is early access, there are quite a few bugs, I've seen some people complain about the cats animation being crap...it's an early access indie game for two dollars what do you want? Besides it's far better than so many other games I've played.

It's relaxing, the little mini games are pretty fun. There is a third option in the menu called 'Cat Planet' I would be curious to see what this becomes as it says 'coming soon' when you go to click on it, like the farm survival but damn did I make a mistake getting too close to that cow. Don't touch the cows. They're probably angry at me for killing all of their friends in minecraft. Chickens too. That's why I decided to hunt the rats. Don't worry they aren't the overpowered and godly Halo 3 rat they kill easily. Really pick this game up if you are on the fence about it it's good fun even if you just play it for an hour. 

I'm satisfied.

6789,1469300,"What an interesting game.   I would recommend but if you're looking for serious lewd, look elsewhere.  The writing, story, and choices are really the star here with the lewd simply coming at the end. I played with the DLC.  The difference is that there are four princesses in the main game and three dark princesses in the DLC.   

This is an adult visual novel (AVN) where the choices you make matter.   The character needs to build up stats that gate success in the world and with the girls.   Many achievements are locked behind dying.   When you replay, you keep your stats (kinda) so death doesn't matter as much, but as you build your stats, failure will become harder.  FYI if you want achievements.   The lewd content is locked behind winning the game and the hand of the princess as well as discovering the various plots against the kingdom.

Animations - Cute but minimal animation.

Sound - I usually play with sound off but I did turn it on and one character definitely had sexy sounds.

Game Play - Key notes are that you have to build up stats to win the game and failure will happen without stats.   It may be possible to win the game in the first pass, but the game will keep your original game stats for a following play through.  What I did NOT know is that your second play through has temporary stats, until you have an interaction with various females.   This will, one time only, reset a stat but allow  you to continue building it.   I thought this was a bug and quit one of my playthroughs.  The result is one of my stats was lower than it could have been.   This is important if you do a third play through and space out the extra girls.   

The day is split in two phases.  The first phase is an opportunity to build stats (and even get some story lines, but spoiler) and the second phase is wooing the princesses which can also build stats.   The character is limited to 30 days and there are three events that will also take place.

Dating Sim:   I wouldn't really call this a dating sim because your choices don't really win the girl, your ability to have stats high enough to succeed is what wins the game.

The writing:   The writing is great.   A little bit of prose, and interesting premise, and a quick play through with cute stories.  

The fun:  Very much more cute and vanilla vs aggressive or hard core.  There's a sweetness to the writing that I appreciated.  The scenes are more jiggly than really animated but I was more into the story so I didn't mind too much.  Each princess has a different preference in bed, so the variation is nice.

Duration:   I know the game says I have 12 hours into it but the reality is that I probably have around 6-8 hours including the various paths I've explored.  It keeps running in the background while you're away from keyboard.   Keep in mind this includes the dark princesses paths aka the DLC.

Value:  I'm mixed on the value.  The story felt short, but there's replay-ability and the story itself was good and drew me in with the writing.   I think I would watch for this on sale.

Ranking:  I think I would put this at A tier on the strength of the story.  Lewd scenes would probably rate a C.  Cute, but nothing special and lagging behind many other games that are out there.  Additionally, because you only have so many princesses you don't get a lot.

I absolutely recommend this if the above all appeals to you and you'll enjoy a cute quick read.   I would recommend waiting until there's a sale for the purchase as I think that value is probably the best.  At $20, that price seem high for the game and DLC with only about 6-8 hours of play, although I do have a few more paths to play through.",1,1717684746,796,0,93
6790,1469330,"Simple recommendation: Buy the game (as is if the price remains $1.99)

Rating 3 out of 5 stars (3 being the minimum to recommend a game).

TL;DR - Despite the awkward controls and lack of end story, the price
is low enough and the game is just functional enoughto justify purchasing it.

THE PROS

1- The price. At the time of this review, I purchased this game for US $1.99.
Although this game is finished and can be played through to the end, the
level of quality is essentially that of an early access game. However, for me 
that price is low enough to justify the purchase of the game.

2 - Hit detection. Hit detection is very good, with visual indicators of hits.
This game appears to be the first one done by this creator, so getting hit
detection right on his first fighting game is a huge plus and something 
the creator should be congratulated for.

3 - Character Model Animation and Clarity. The movements of the character models
are very life like and the clarity of the character models when fighting is good.
As this is a 3D game, the creator has chosen to have realistic stances based on 
positioning. Depening on which direction your character is facing, their back or 
chest wwill be facing the camera. Parts of your character's body can be obscured
by the camera but even when this happens you can see what movements and actions 
are taking place.

4 - Character Textures and distinctiveness. The textures look good and 
the characters are sufficiently distinict to tell them apart

5 - Fast Load Times. I have played fighting games made on the Unity Engine
(Shaolin vs. Wutang) with very very long load times. The load times for
stages on this game are much much faster on the same engine.

THE CONS
1 - Key/Button Mapping. -- There is an input selection in options but
the only thing it does is show the controls. It either does not permit
remapping of the controls, or the option to remap controls is not 
sufficiently clear for me to understand how to use it. I personally
find the first player keyboard controls awkward. There are 3rd party 
applications available to re-map keys. Given the price point of the game
this is a non-fatal flaw, but it is an annoying one. I have not tested 
controler support.

2 - Obscuring or Unclear Environment. On one level a monitor or picture
gets between the camera and both characters, though rare, this is annoying.
There is a level with an asphalt floor that is so similar in color to 
Gwen's leggings, that Gwen's legs become transparent, making it difficult
to see. As with the previous point, this is non-fatal but annoying.


3 - No End Story. There are compelling stories in the biographies
in the character selection screen, but when I played the game there
was no ending or resolution to these stories apart from a congratulations
screen.


THE DIFFERNT (Neither pro nor con)
1 - Number of rounds. The most common options for fighting games are 
best 2 out of 3 rounds or player selected number of rounds. 
This game has best 3 out of 4 which isn't good or bad, just different.

2 - Typos. There are minor typos and unclear language throughout the game.
The impression that I get is not that this is due to a lack of effort, but
rather that English is not the creator's first language, or that the creator
uses a distinct (non-American, non-British) variant of written English.
As someone who has played and enjoyed fighting games in languages he cannot
read (Japanese), this is neither a pro or con but different. All of the 
instructions and information are clear, despite these typos or differences.

3 - Resolution. This game does not offer a 1920 x 1080 resolution, and it
was released in 2020. This is not a pro because it is a graphical limitation
but it is also not a con because it may help contribute to the fast loading
times. The game looks perfectly crisp and clear and plays well for me.


SUGGESTIONS:
1 - To the creator: Put more information about the game on the steam page.
If you are open to doing more work on thegame, set a financial goal
and commit to improving the game if you reach it. If it's worth your time,
you could justify charging a higher price if the game were a bit more polished

2 - To gamers: If a couple bucks is make or break for you, consider passing on
this game, but if you have the money to spare, as stated above I recommend buying.",1,1639853276,103,0,5

6793,1469340,"Composer here. This is the first time I've heard my music in a game released on Steam and on consoles, which feels pretty surreal. I guess, as plus points go, that's gonna be pretty unique to me, though.

Leaving obvious bias at the door, this game is great fun. I can certainly see myself firing it up when I want to pass a little time. The gameplay doesn't try to do anything groundbreaking, but because of that, it's intuitive, and it's tightly-tuned for a really satisfying feel.

The graphics are clear, too, with some good telegraphing. I particularly like how shadow distances are used to help you quickly gauge whether something's on the ground or at the same height as your chopper. The visuals are bright and colourful, and authentic to that 16-bit Japanese PC look.

Ironically, I think the sound needs more work. There's no menu music or sound effects, and the volume of the gameplay sound effects is all over the place. I know my M-DRIVE pack didn't offer a huge amount of tracks for an action game like this, but it would have been nice to hear more than two different BGM tracks, a game over jingle, and a victory jingle upon completing a level. Finishing a level currently feels a bit flat, as the helicopter lands and resupplies and the music just sort of fades out with no fanfare. There were game over and victory jingles in the pack for moments like these, y'know.~

Other than that, I have no criticisms for this little gem, and especially at such a reasonable price, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a satisfying way to kill twenty minutes.",1,1669894313,135,0,6

Fans of #shmups should find it enjoyable and moderately difficult.

I like shooters but hate bullet hell, and this seems to fit somewhere in between. It's a slow-paced retro shooter that gets a bit more difficult as you go along, providing moderate challenge.. and maybe that's its charm?

The developer has spent next to nothing on bringing awareness to this fun little game (not sure if the language was a factor).

Still, a small game worth playing.",1,1613989471,92,0,1
6795,1469340,"Here is the thing with this style of shmup....just looking at the photos you will have a very good idea if this is your game or not.

Gyro Blade is an ok shmup, but doesn't really stand out in any area. It is extremely basic with just movement and an attack button. The enemies are standard, the power-ups are standard, the difficulty is standard, the game speed is standard, and so forth. It really doesn't feel like it progressed passed the NES days of 1985. In fact...by the time you think of games like Xevious or Legendary Wings....you have already surpassed this one in depth.

Here is where the real problem is: I can't say it isn't fun. Repetitive, yes, and to a greater degree more repetitive then say 1942...but it isn't boring. But is it $5 fun?

You can do better. So my advice to shmup fans: get the game on a big discount (like $1), or don't get it at all. It is really that simple.",0,1694939094,18,0,387
6796,1469340,"Great fun for anyone into Retro games, particularly Tiger Heli. If you're into PC Engine type shooters or anything of the sort, you'll probably like this. Basically the perfect treat for a Retro Gamer.",1,1652476555,82,20,9
6797,1469340,"Meh.

You probably already realize this is an old school style shmup. It's not bad. It's just meh.

It's mechanically barren. You move your helicopter and you shoot. Every level seems to have 3 helicopter enemies that drop a power up. This power up will rotate between green and orange. Green is a more focused and powerful straight shot while orange is a spread out wide shot. You can power these up 5 times by collecting more power ups without dying. Due to this, the game does have a bit of a gradius syndrome where the game gets harder when you die. This is mostly because enemies are somewhat tanky in this game, so without a powered up weapon, it's hard to clear the screen of enemies and you have to do more dodging.

Scoring is about as basic as they come in shmups. You gain score from killing enemies and picking up ""P"" stars, which are worth 1000 points each at the end of the level. When you lose all your lives and you use a credit, your score resets to 0. That's it. To high score you want to kill as many enemies as possible, pick up as many stars as possible, and not die.

The game's 8 levels feel like a repetitive slog. While I think the game has a decent variety of enemies, their shot and movement patterns just aren't very interesting. Bosses are also a push over, at least on easy and normal. I find them easier than the actual level itself, which is a bummer for a shmup. 

The music is good, but I'm pretty sure it's just one music used on every level.

There is no scoreboard. You can see your highest score while playing, but there is no extended scoreboard showing you all your top 10 scores/stats or anything of that nature. There's also no online leaderboard. Options are also pretty lacking. There's no tate mode or custom options like life limit or credit limit. No achievements. No trading cards. No multiplayer.

Overall, this is a very basic package. I definitely don't recommend buying at $5, and even on sale I only recommend to those who really love these early style shmups.",0,1616639436,56,0,103
6798,1469340,"Looks great, and the gameplay is simple.  Controls are tight with an old wired 360.  However, it is one of those arcade style designs where things get tougher and more numerous until you inevitably die.  Once you do, you respawn in the middle of that upgraded malestrom with the puny starter weapon, requiring multiple hits to take down the most basic of targets, meaning the fight is now basically impossible.  When this happens in a boss fight, you might as well start over.

This leads me to the ultimate conclusion: when a game treats you like it needs quarters to survive, even thought it lives with you in your house and you handle all the bills, it is not your friend.",0,1721573213,10,0,8

First of all, it's so good that this game was released on Steam itself, but it seems like it needs constant updates like someone else's opinion. Even if this game doesn't have a point store, I'd like to at least have an achievements or trading card. Also, the full screen didn't apply, so I felt awkward while playing... I agree with others.

In other words, I've been waiting for the release of this game for quite a long time, but I don't know the difference with the mobile version. I'm upset that I don't feel rewarded as much as I waited, but on the other hand, I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], so I'll continue to play happily. I sincerely hope one day <Black Moor 2> or the old game <Maximus 1> etc. will be released on Steam! Thank you for reading the long article!


(Edit: From now on, full screen functionality is supported in the option, and exit menus that I didn't mention but didn't exist before have been added! Thx!

However, it was quite confusing that only the default operating key still appeared on the game screen. If you're new to this game, and if you change the manipulation button like me, it can be confusing enough.

When trying to simulate a battle, you'll be forced to listen to units talking in forced, silly voices. This breaks the immersion of someone who especially just wants to simulate a large battle.

The games music is broken and continues playing at the loudest volume possible, the loading and performance is heavily unoptimized to the point where even my 1070 and i7 seem stressed. The hit registration is confusing and inconsistent as hell when you think you should hit or be hit by a melee weapon, it doesnt land, not to mention most guns dont sound or hit the way you would think, a shotgun seems to fire as if it was a semi automatic assault rifle without any power, it feels like its shooting 5.56 or 9mm rounds. The spells have no impact and aren't explained either. If you want to go in barehanded you cant even attack. The loading of levels is just strange and laggy. Nothing really motivates me to move forward, and this first impression has been a very sour one so far. I can't recommend this game so far although it looks like it can have potential.

6843,1468800,"I really wanted to like this game given its similarity to hotline miami, as well as looking really gorgeous, but there are just too many things wrong with it for this to be currently sold out of early access. Some examples being, the game being 20gb when it can be compressed down to 10gb through Compactor, it being incredibly unoptimized (my 1060,i7-7k, 16gb of ram rig struggling to push out 50-60 fps), not being able to turn off/turn down the repetitive music even though theres an option in settings(!), melee weapons feeling incredibly clunky, and falling out of the literal map. On the other hand, I will say that there are some really good aspects about the game such as the previously mentioned graphics being really pretty and some of the mechanics are kind of interesting. However in its current state I feel the dev has just rushed the gun on marketing this spaghetti code, and if he really felt that he wanted to make it great, his plan should have been making some version of this a free demo and THEN publish a polished game, instead of the current mess that it is. However, I suspect that this game has ultimately been abandoned given there havent been any updates since april of this year (and it was published of january of this year), but I suppose time will tell.

It is fully translated to english, but it can be a bit janky in some menu's, but honestly it makes little difference, everything works, and all the features were so well thought out that i found it pretty intuitive.

The pictures in the store page do not do this game justice. Its one of those games that because of the art style, doesn't photograph well.

Paying this, it honestly reminds me of titles like M&B Warband and CK2, the graphics might not be the best, the screen shots or even video's might not sell the games. But when you actually play them you come to realise they are absolutely fantastic and even genera defining.

If you are looking for a Wuxia/Xianxia style cultivation RPG, this really is the one to get. Looking at steam you will see alot of titles in this genra and they all kind of blend together, it can be overwhelming if you are looking to dip your toes in.

but there is a reason why, if you do a quick google search, you will find this game constantly mentioned in peoples lists of must play Wuxia or Xianxia titles. And thats because this game really sets the benchmark.

Prior to this title, it was Tale of Wuxia that did that, and while thats still a great game, that was 2016, this is 2023, and there is a new king in town.

Yes it is a good game I only managed to scratch the surface on this iceberg.

Ok update so far the Devs just need to put more focus on localization get it polished because there are still a lot more text that need translation fixes

6854,1468950,"Since I'm the first person who will give an opinion to this game, here are my two cents:
The game is kinda like a hack and slash/jump n'run game, you run around smash a lot the fight button to bring the evil mummies out of life (?) or smash them into little beautiful orbs, which refills your magic bar, with magic you obtain during the first levels. On every level is an evil boss who tries to keep the treasure of Anubis. 

I played a lot of jump n run games and I love them. Devil Edge is from the difficulty like medium to hard. (Honestly I hated the volcano level, this was pretty hard :D). I didnt found major problems on the game though, the controls are smooth, no lags in the movement, these two guys really did a good job on this one. 

I had a lot of fun playing it. It was a bit ""short"" (the end game result is two hours) but I loved the level design with the Anubis statues and the monster design had also that typical ancient egyptian style.

6877,1468240,"Fun game but you have to enjoy high difficulty to get it. Also, the game isn't exactly a Metroidvania, but fans of open-ended, nonlinear exploration will like it, provided you also enjoy the thrust-based core gameplay. If you're casually into space shoot 'em ups and don't like ""git gud"" games, don't expect the Metroidvania stuff to carry the game for you.

I'm not a huge fan of this genre so I can't say how it stacks up, but combat and movement are pretty slick. There's a lot of physics fun on display with stuff like being pushed back when shooting. Controls feel pretty smooth. Enemy variety is good and interesting, and you often face mobs that have interesting synergies. There's one enemy in particular that moves really fast and will drain your energy at close range that haunts my nightmares. There's some interesting lore hinted at as you travel. It's nothing major but enough to make me think the story is building up to something and more than these kind of games usually have.

The game has a few teething problems that I was able to forgive. Sometimes it's hard to tell if a stationary object is in the same plane as you, or if it's in the foreground or background. Some things that look like a solid wall, you can actually move past them since they're not really in that plane. I eventually was able to spot ahead of time which objects those were. You have two types of currency for upgrades, but one is so plentiful that you'll never be short on it, so really there's only one kind of currency that matters. I used to have problems learning what to do or which buttons do what functions, but the developer has since added tutorial messages and a control overlay on the loading screen. So if you pick this game up now, you won't have those problems.

Also, in my opinion, the game is too stingy with upgrades. You are constantly bombarded with crates with currency and blueprints for new upgrades. But almost every time I found a new blueprint, I'd be 100 ""juice"" short of being able to build it, and I was still saving up for the blueprint I found 8 crates ago. Eventually, it stopped being fun to find new blueprints because I could only afford to build a fraction of them. This might be part of an RPG like system, where you can customize and upgrade the weapons you do use, but in my opinion it's a point against it being a Metroidvania. Finding a secret in Super Metroid is always exciting because it's an immediate benefit. Here, most secrets are just a small amount of currency and more blueprints you won't be able to build any time soon.

But my biggest problem was the map. It doesn't show borders, so there's nothing to distinguish between a dead end and a corridor you haven't explored fully. Or sometimes an area on the map looks like it's connected but when you get there, there's a wall that didn't show up on the map and you can't actually get through that way. I spent a good 45 minutes going in circles at one point with no idea where to go next. To their credit, the dev did add a function where every time you open a gate, it blinks on the map screen so you know where to go next. But this didn't fix every problem I had.

Eventually the game proved too difficult and frustrating for me. There are sections of laser gate challenges that were too long for my tastes, sometimes with enemies inside. And if you die, you have to start all over again. Sometimes these also included branching paths but no save spot nearby. A couple times, I found something interesting branching off one of these laser corridors, but didn't want to explore it because I knew if I ran into a tough fight and died, I would have to repeat the laser challenge just to take a second crack at the fight. You have to enjoy that Soulslike ""git gud"" mentality to enjoy this game. Other challenges include long fights with wave after wave of opponents and defending nodes from attack. If you like these kind of games and don't mind a challenge, you might enjoy it a lot more. But for me as someone idly curious of the genre and hoping for more Metroidvania elements, the game eventually got more difficult to be fun for me.

So check it out if you like the genre but do be prepared for a challenge and to repeat some sections in between save points.",1,1620797607,507,0,89
6878,1468240,"Clunky controls, non-existent settings, poor enemy design. It tries to use controls from a classic like Asteroid or thrust and fails at it. Moving feels like ass while enemies can swim through and weave at will. Barely any momentum maintained from boosting meaning trying to strafe is near impossible since stopping will immediately begin decelerating your speed to 0. Trying to aim your weapon is terrible because of this plus your weapon is off center which it even more of a poor experience. Moving it is very imprecise making large rotations for fine adjustments. Firing means you get pushed back but since your weapon is offset and your orientation/aiming indicator is useless for stupid reasons means the issue is exacerbated.

Difficulty in this game means you are made of paper mache with a shield of cardboard and a thruster powered by fart. Early enemies just eat thru your shield while having a their own that tanks your shots and they are normally in groups. There are even enemies just about the size of your bullets that are frustrating because of the aforementioned issues. Proximity mines, for whatever reason, are plopped in front of you and will randomly choose to go off or not. If it does while you're there you'll take damage which is understandable if not for the fact that movement feels like ass. You are completely within it before you can maneuver. Why not use boost? Because the game tries to be a corridor shooter meaning you will slam into a wall. The way the environment is designed makes it difficult to distinguish if it's in the foreground or not.

A game shouldn't take hours to feel right yet right off the bat it feels bad. I'm unsurprised there is little fanfare. There are people that are fine with bashing their head and tolerating this kind of clunk but I'm not one of them. It doesn't matter if you're indie, the only part you get scott-free on that is pricing and I would not buy this if it wasn't on sale.

QoL would greatly improve if we could move our ship in directions other than the direction we are facing, but you can't. Which means if you need to move just a tiny bit to the left you have to turn ur ship 90 degrees, throttle, and then turn back. Also, since it's low gravity and your ship doesnt have inertia dampeners or RCS (for some reason) you are constantly having to throttle on/off and rotate to stay where you want.

6886,1468240,"Carebotz is an indie game developed by one person, and its similar to Hollow Knight in game play style, piloting bibz and maintaining your momentum and shooting enemies (Who are generally small from what ive seen) can be really hard to get used to, where as in hollow knight you have to micromanage (dodging your enemies while platforming with the tight controls and movement and the game is not forgiving at all) and the same goes for this game. To be totally honest I've never really played a game with physics like this one so I'm TERRIBLE at it but its really fun so far. I've read some reviews complaining that there's no tutorial and ""Good luck figuring out the controls"" and i couldn't help but laugh at them. The game is supposed to be hard and a retro game y'all i don't remember a single game back in the game that had a brief tutorial. As for the controls part i agree there needs to be a slight change in how they work, you don't really know, I've been gaming forever now and it took me a few mins but like that's barely a problem imo (cause it can be fixed in very little amount of time). The reviews about the controller support is a bit confusing to me cause if my old janky controller setup works with steam BP mode idk how anyone else's controller won't.

It is exciting, with nice graphics and sound, however it sometimes a quite difficult (at least to me) but I'm still learning. Currently I'm using a keyboard but I'm pretty sure a controller could improve a lot in the gaming experience.

There is a simple rule of ""avoid obstacles"", and this is a specification that even monkeys can understand.
You can do this endlessly because there is no more interesting goal.
As the record grows, the beginning may not be more interesting, but the feeling of knocking just before the record break and the feeling of running, which gradually increases, is all fun!!
In addition, there are no additional functions, the user interface is simple and this is a game that is familiar to everyone, regardless of age.

The feeling of the game is very interesting.If you say decisively, then this is the moment when I want to show the score when the game is over.I think otherwise it's a divine game.

--Positives of the dlc--

weapons look great, actual new models not reskins and they also look fitting with the game as they arent glowing and stuff.

A new SMG is nice additon and the pistol being a desert eagle reminds me of the heavy pistol in dead island.


SIlenced pistol uses normal pistol ammo and the suppressor dose not block the sights making it easy to use.


--Negatives of the dlc--

SMG's uses same anamations as the barrel smg and it looks odd, rifle anamations would fit better.

The desert eagles slide dose not move when shooting or when the gun is empty.

The silencer would have looked far better on the SMG and the pistol but thats my opinion.

Now this is of course my opinion, but I think there should be a special secret ops DLC vendor instead of giving us blueprints. It's just plain unrealistic that I can make a silenced factory new pistol by mixing a normal pistol with some ductape. A special DLC secret ops / CIA vendor would;
- Add immersion. 
- Give us a less flooded blueprints section.
- Be cooler (imagine dealing with a CIA agent or smth).

It could also give the silenced pistol a heftier price because the fact it needs no subsonic ammo and is still silenced makes it WAY too op. I say this considering I can make 50 versions of this gun atm. It's not that rare.",0,1607030263,0,0,7

The Suppressed Pistol is very useful as it does NOT use the ""subsonic ammo"" type which is very difficult to find and also expensive to craft, it instead uses the REGULAR pistol ammo. The ""Soaring Death"" SMG is a certified demolisher destroyer, so I recommend using it.

- Do they add anything unique to the game? (Eg. new mechanics or buffs)
Nope.

- What do I think of the outfit?
Pretty good actually. Although the american CIA uniform definitely does not fit into a Turkish country lol.

- Do the DLC Items add anything unique to the game? (Passive buffs)
Nope, just good weapons like most other bundles.

[h1]Overall rating: 6/10[/h1]
The Pistol will be incredibly useful to players who like to play stealthily as being able to dispatch zombies from range without alerting virals is a massive advantage. 
The SMG is actually really good if you dont care about the fact that it is loud. It has the best accuracy and rate of fire for an SMG in the game.

Story feels like it's been told a few times too many already and it has a few problems with the game only progressing after performing specific actions with no indication for what those are or why you're stuck. It's also short, which is fair for the price, but still, it's over before you could really get into it, while also letting you spend the larger middle portion of the game on plotwise unimportant stuff. Puzzles are either banal or completely obtuse with nothing in between, but still decent enough.

6974,1468390,"Review Type: Active Update.
Duration: (11.3 hours at update) 
Early Access: Version 0.7 Beta
Hardware: Valve Index, Nvidia 1650 Super 4gb, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb RAM.

TDLR : After using Argil, I look forward to seeing Valkyrie industries smack the fuck out of Adobe/autodesk & other shitty competing VR Sculpt software as Argil becomes a standard product in this sector.

Used to Blender/Zbrush/Medium causing heart attacks, Autodesk, Marv. designer & Adobe pricing schemes that screw over your wallet.
If you can glance at my steam reviews or see them on other stores/websites,
you can see, in general, I give toxic & critical reviews over, not about games but instead, production software(IDEs, 3d modeling, drawing, blueprinting). 
This is because I view purchasing software tools as purchasing time saved. Software tools that waste your time deserve to be reamed. Argil continues to consistently impress me.

Performance:
Early access software always means there are possibly latent early access effects.
For what it's worth, Argil is stable on my desktop system.
On my current hardware, as of Beta ver 0.7, I don't crash and there was no lag or processing hang ups.
Objects/sculpt pieces have a max of 65535 due to Unity limits. You have can have multiple objects in your scene. Kicking it up to max, I was not suffering hang ups.

Good: 
Products such as Adobe Medium and Gravity Sketch are the 9/11 of VR sculpting with what happened to them.
Products such as Argil are the 9/11 of VR sculpting programs except the planes went backwards, never crashing & everything turned out for the better. 
Vulgar yes but genuinely looks like the developers looked at other platforms & studied what made them so inefficient & annoying to use. They did the most magical thing any software developer can do.
[u]They didn't repeat their predecessors mistakes.[/u]
They look at the criticisms of other platforms and say ""let's not do that"".

Argil takes advantage of the VR space with a fairly intuitive UI setup built into your controllers. They don't let the workspace become a bumbling ""Look mom Im in VR world!""
It respects you are going to be stationary around one center piece most of the time, not walking around your room with awful movement controls and punching your monitor ala Tiltbrush.

You don't need to go looking into a deeply compacted UI to find something such as Zbrush & Blender. You want it, it's either right there or a click/2 away around your wrist neatly in tabs.

I should say, Wrists. Argil recognizes it's annoying to need to constantly switch between brushes/tools in a workflow. Both controllers can be used as separate brushes at the same time. You really will be using both of your hands to sculpt with some powerful brush tools.

Seriously, hats off to the developers that made the brush tools. It's legitimately well done. There isn't 90 different ultra complex brushes that fuck up your detail for even considering. There is a nice basic set of sculpting brushes that T. Howard ""Just Work"" without the scam.

Vertice system & resolution brush.
Argil handle all faces via triangles. Importing a model will either triangulate or you will need to triangulate your import first.
If you're looking for quads, the way Argil sets up it's system lets you easily export to another program and to convert to quads fairly simple. 
The developers knew what they were doing when they chose this path(That and Unity handles by triangles). 
They developed a brush that can only be described as Satan's Brush. The Resolution Brush. 
It giveth & taketh vertices by remeshing [b]A LOCAL BRUSH REGION/PORTION[/b] of your model. No it's not mesh restitching like Zbrush does to fucks up your faces.
It adds & subtracts geometry on the spot by performing a simplification/direct sub division algorithm on a region. It's voodoo. It's legit the Exodia of 3d tools.
This brush is worth the low early access cost by itself. 
I wish I could shake the hands of the developers for this fucking thing, Oh dear lord the hours I have spent trying to correct issues that should have never started in the first place that this brush overrides on the spot.
Buying this brush [b]is[/b] buying saved time.

Update: A skilled and talented developer has made me eat my words.
As of Beta 0.7, Argil currently features a draw/generate mesh lines in real time similar to Medium.

Features I've noticed absent from other platforms:
You're allowed to sit down. Why this isn't standard is beyond me.
Axis Lock: Choice to disable free rotation.
Axis Realignment(This should also restore rotation).
Mirror (Some kink)
File system: Doesn't force you to remove your headset 
Reference Images: Why isn't this standard for all yet?
Complex Material System: You can view your mesh/sculpt in wireframe/face, smooth, marble, metallic, plastic, etc. 
Change environment which will also change the lighting conditions.
Integrated mesh bases to speed up block out.
Third Person Camera View for demonstrations and recordings.
The other reviewer says the program has no import/export after 6 mins of using it.
They are a fucking dumbass. There is. 

Suggestions:
Don't sell to Adobe, Autodesk or Google when they come knocking. I am convinced this is the VR Sculpting program we were all waiting for. 

Restore total symmetry option. Projects can be become degenerate, this ends up becoming more important than it seems because uneven distortions have a perturbation effect. 
Direct file naming or alt file naming schema. 

Fast/favorite select. I'd honestly like to convert the 'a' key to fast swap between 2 brushes on a hand.    
Same thing with materials. I'd like a way to swap immediately between 2 chosen mat files. Could store on right hand.
The undo system could be more refined. It's inconsistent at times.

Advertise Argil more. I'd do more myself even with my own time constraints.
I only found out about Argil after searching VR sculpting on steam, and it was listed after Koikatsu Party because Gabe Newell decides to advertise straight porn instead of realizing they can make Autodesk tier money releasing VR digital design tools. 

Considerations:
If you prefer running around your room making streams of glowing bubbles laughing as a unicorn behind you shits rainbows in Tilt Brush or Gravity Sketch's NURB sculpting(let's be real this is what it is),
Argil does not function the same.    

If you prefer Zbrush Zspheres to block out or mesh block out in general(sculpting the general form and then refining it heavily), Argil can probably achieve the similar to better results in 1/4 to 1/8 the time with practice.

Argil has recently gained mesh draw similar to Adobe Medium.

If you want to 3d print your sculpts/models/meshes, Argil produces generally strict 3d models. You need to be trying to fuck up the geometry.

If you're a game developer, animator, modeler or digital artist, the resolution brush is a [b]controlled decimation/subdivision tool over the local brush area[/b].
I don't think I've ever seen a tool such as it that allows you to fine tune and optimize detail without excessive sub - d/retopology.

Overall, Argil doesn't sit *between* Adobe Medium and Zbrush on a line. It has it's own place forming a triangle of where digital sculpting should be. A place strong enough to convince me to uninstall competitors.
Argil is digital VR sculpting. Plain and Simple. I can't emphasize this enough if the name wasn't a giveaway. 

You're probably asking, Is it healthy for someone to write all of this after a short time of using it?
On one hand, no.
On the other hand, believe in the Adderall that pulsates through my veins and give it a try. 
I wrote this review after ages of paying for shitty software and being let down.

6980,1468420,"Sexcraft is an NSFW platformer that you [b]don't[/b] want to come back to.

I took about 5 min thinking what positives i could list, and i can hardly remember any. The backgrounds look nice, but i feel like i've seen them somewhere already. Music is beautiful too, but hardly fits the game. It's too heroic and epic, and it plays while you are humping some guard on the roof of a tower. Contrast it to the negatives, which come to mind immediately:

olist]
    [*][b]No checkpoints.[/b] You die, you start the level from the start. By itself, it wouldn't be much of a problem, since the game isn't particularly hard, and enemies are kinda dumb, but it becomes a serious issue with the next point.
    [*][b]Traps and pits are instakills.[/b] That would also be an issue too small to mention by itself, but coupled with previous point, it makes the game very frustrating. This is a platformer and jumping sections are a big part of the game by design. One small error and you have to go through the entire level of dumb enemies, slow combat and tedious gameplay again. This could've been fixed either by introducing checkpoints, or by simply dealing damage to you and teleporting you to the last solid piece of ground you touched.
    [*][b]Camera.[/b] Another thing adding to the pile is camera placement. It always holds your character below center, regardless of your actual position on the level, which leaves the lower part of the level out of screen. Many jumping sections require you to go down, and ""down"" often means ""there are tiny platforms with pits under them"". You can crouch, but the camera switch has a pretty long delay, and time isn't something you have when surrounded by enemies, however slow and dumb they are.
    [*][b]Miscellaneous.[/b]
The game is very slow. Your movement speed is slow and there is no sprint or sort of upgrade to that. Enemies are slow too and sometimes get stuck on terrain.
The delay between your shots is massive. As if that wasn't enough, you've got mana to worry about, which makes consecutive encounters even slower, but at least it's restoring automatically.
You can only shoot left and right, no directional inputs are applied. Have a turret on the ceiling? Ignore it or risk the jumping action.
Shot range feels frustratingly small.
Mandatory finishers grow old very fast. It's not ""you've done great job beating this encounter, here's a fancy animation to make you feel good"", it's ""lock yourself in place, waste a few seconds watching bland animation you've seen 100 times to get rid of ONE enemy."" It's good that the devs tried to implement NSFW and general gameplay together, instead of making it a compensation for loss, but doing it every time is tedious. Just let the enemies die.
The animations themselves are kinda meh, as well as static art. Speaking of art, the only good looking one is probably the cover one.
It seems that achievements are broken, because i've opened all the books in the first chapter, but only the first one was credited.

This game is simply not fun to play. It could've been less frustrating if there was a proper checkpoint system, or if ledges and spikes weren't instakills, but even then the game is just boring.",0,1637058285,93,0,23

-Nice aesthetic and good overall art

Cons
-Having to use lewd moves to finish off enemies takes time and gets repetitive really fast
-Game is punishingly difficult (touching spikes or missing jumps is insta-death, and there are no mid-level checkpoints), unless you activate cheat codes, which makes the gameplay trivial
-Story featured through prominent cutscenes, but somehow still doesn't explain what is going on well enough to follow

Conclusion
I was seriously considering refunding this until they released the cheat codes, which at least let me finish the game. Without cheat codes, most players will find this game punishingly difficult and very frustrating.",0,1633513681,126,0,79
6983,1468420,"Platformer game from Hentai Room. Does it deserve the negative rating it has?

As a magic practitioner, Sofiya, you venture into dungeons and cemetaries to discover the history behind your clan's rules. As you progress through the 45 dungeons, you will find books revealing bits of the story, but don't expect much here; the explanations are vague and way too brief. There is only one ending, and you can rather easily find all of the books, so one playthrough is sufficient to see everything. 
The focus was placed on the platforming parts. Ok, I get it. The moving pace feels very sluggish in comparison to similar titles, but it is not as detrimental to the gameplay as other reviews describe it. I won't count it as negative. It is what it is, and I got used to it shortly after starting. Aside from platforming, you also have various enemies to deal with. You have only one basic attack and three special ones to fight them. There is not much variety here, even considering that it is a budget title. After a few hits, most enemies will wave a white flag for a moment. You can then activate the sex finisher to eliminate them. This takes a few seconds and can't be skipped, so the pace suffers. However, with the double jump, you can avoid most enemies, so you don't need to kill them all. Especially since you don't gain experience from fighting, just recovery items and special shots.
The main difficulty of this game is the platforming aspect. Most spikes are one hit k.o., and there are no checkpoints, but the levels are very short, so I don't feel like checkpoints are necessary in the first place. I certainly did not struggle much to complete levels, and I managed to clear most without any deaths. It is not a precision platformer, so I don't get why people cry about the difficulty. I'm certainly not a pro at platforming. Similarly, the three boss fights are pretty basic and easy to win.
Next, I need to mention some negatives. Despite being a short, budget title, the lack of creativity is evident. There is very little variety of enemies, levels feel samey, and there is no character progression. Even at this low price, I expected a bit more. I can't say I hated playing it, but I was not very amused either. To the developer's defence, I believe it is the first platformer game he has made, so perfection is not expected. Still, more could've been done. I rate the experience as neutral.

The pixel art is somewhat below average. The finisher animations lack polish and quality but are fluid enough to see what is happening.
Sadly, there is little variety of scenes. Dungeons lack creativity as well. Some are way too short, and others feel too bland. Certainly, more work could be put into their creation. The visuals are slightly below my expectations as well.

The music is pretty simple but mostly fits the theme. Nothing really stands out, but nothing sounded annoying either. Just good enough. The sound effects are a bit lacking, though.

No bugs encountered, but on one of the levels, I fell on spikes that did not kill me. Rather insignificant glitch.

Overall, a very simplistic platformer with some sexy pixel art and okay music. Even for a budget title, it all feels a bit uninspired and repetitive. I find it hard to recommend this game, but my actual rating would be neutral. It's certainly not the worst I've seen, but more effort should've been put into the development. 4.6/10",0,1702125545,386,0,237

Fuck all the negative reviews, this is a pretty decent little side scrolling pixel platformer in the vain of an obscure Super Nintendo or Commodore Amiga game. If you were around in those days then you will probably appreciate it. The graphics are good enough, the music is really good imo, some bits reminded me of FFVII and Castlevania. The game is split into 3 chapters with about 15 levels in each and a boss fight at the end of each chapter.
Reading these negative reviews makes me think that these guys are kids or haven't been playing games for a minute.
It's not a hard game and the levels don't take long to get through, so checkpoints would make it far too easy. As for falling down pits and traps and dying??? Tell me a game in this genre where that doesn't happen.
The only complaint I agree with is the mana points, there's no need. All the other complaints just sound like the normal things you find in games of this genre.
I don't think this game deserves the negative tag, it's not the best game and it's not for everyone, but I enjoyed it and I'm sure if you like this genre of game you will to.

I was surprised there was no achievement for that, not one.
I must say despite negative reviews, i like the game itself but i do find the lack of checkpoint system just as frustrating as everyone else. Useless seducing bad guys for health and mana when its an instakill on the terrain. I did like this though with the guards: [spoiler]Finding the non heterosexual ones cos they turned my sexy ass down and said no! XD[/spoiler]

In a nutshell, no crafting, the game itself is misleading there. No upgrades so far that i can tell, just a typical 2D side scrolling platformer with small NSFW scenes thrown in for viewing pleasure. They become tedious to repeat over and over tho, and boring, and here i got excited at first of being stabbed by a sword multiple times XP

To the Devs, its a good game but without the checkpoints makes the game more pain and less pleasure for me, and no, not the good kind of pain either. I guess ill eventually grind my way to the top. Can you PLEASE add a check point system?! Pretty please? I cant recommend it in its current state. The coding wouldnt be that difficult for it surely.

TL;DR:
Pros: 
* Easy to obtain health and Mana
* NSFW content within gameplay
* cute aesthetics
* Being stabbed by guards doesnt instakill

Cons:
* Repetitive
* NO CHECKPOINTS - prepare to repeat an entire level if you die!
* Kinda clunky controls, everything feels too stiff
* Camera - doesnt adjust to your position in certain locations making quite a few leaps of faith even with manual adjustment
* Instakill on environmental mishaps
* Time consuming and grindy for little overall reward
* Cannot be played with one hand",0,1679555618,58,0,5

6997,1468430,"It's a solid visual novel. It's relatively short, and it reuses dialog between the two paths which kind of makes the replay a bit annoying to deal with. As an example, both characters love to cook but don't want to make it their career. Fascinating... the first time. Then just awkward the second.

I get the game is on a budget, reusing things is fine in a general sense, but when it comes to character building it's a bit weird. And your PC reacts to everything the same way for the most part too. Kind of puts a damper on the 'dating sim' aspect. 

I still enjoyed it though. The art is solid, the music is there and doesn't grate on your nerves at all. The overall story is simple, but sets things up pretty well. I was somewhat disappointed in how they didn't incorporate the freezer pops more in the 18+ dlc stuff, given the title you'd expect something. But it's more a backdrop for the overall plot of paying rent and the antagonist. And it would've been nice to get a few solo shots, but I guess that's more a review for the 18+ content dlc... 

The primary criticism for me would be the English translation. It's wonky at times. You can still get the intention without being confused, but it's pretty common to find errors.

It's worth giving a go I think. It's not the best visual novel ever, but it's not bad at all. And the devs are neat.",1,1635227580,175,0,370

6999,1468430,"Freezer Pops is Male Doll’s first visual novel and, according to the game guide, it’s inspired by a podcast story sent by their audience. In other words, the developers were inspired by a fun and real episode of a Brazilian person, and a game was made from it. This can be a tricky first challenge and there are pros and cons to the studio's work.

Pros:
-It's a light story starred by and for LGBTQ+ people and its focus is not about usual LGBTQ suffering issues like coming out of the closet, family abandonment,  etc. It's good to see a subject that exist in our queer lives like a gay guy working to pay his rent because it’s not commonly seen in games or in media (generally speaking).
-The art is pretty good.
-There is a soundtrack and even if it's not memorable, it doesn't bother you. It fits the moment.
-There are no fuckboys that reproduce heterosexual oppressions and abuses, at least not in the same level I saw in other gay games on Steam.
-The black character has a background that isn't in any way linked to black stereotypes like black people as bandits, drug dealers, etc. It's pretty interesting to see this character in a social superior position compared to the other guy and the protagonist.
-It’s a story about LGBTQ+ characters who have sex (if you download the DLC) not a story based on sex with LGBTQ+ characters.

Cons:
-There are a lot of moments that are shared in both routes. This is not a big problem if the characters answer them based on their personalities but the game doesn't pay attention to that.
-Some adult topics like working as a cam boy and showing interest in pet play fetish are not developed enough - even if you get the free DLC. It seems they wanted to spotlight these subjects to create tension around the partners' secret but they ended up focusing on other things.
-In the Brazilian Portuguese version, there are mistakes about partners' names. For example, you are playing Fernando's route and sometimes Alexandre calls Fernando by Anderson’s name. Fortunately, they fixed this in the last patch.
-It's relatively short and too linear.
-There are a lot of CGs which make the game unique but I would prefer the traditional novel way. I believe this could give the developers more freedom to work, especially about the topics I’ve mentioned before.

To sum up, I'm giving it a positive review because we can see that Male Doll is always trying to deliver new things, and they had never launched a novel until now. For a first project, it's good enough considering the price and the game quality. Also, there aren’t many studios making bara games on Steam and I want more of them!",1,1643328578,172,0,10
7000,1468430,"On the positive side:
The game has nice graphics and two cute and handsome characters to pursue.
The NSFW add-on adds a handful of static sex scenes.
It has nice music, fitting to the scenes.
I liked the brasilian queer theme.

On the negative side:
It is too short. You finish all routes and all achievements in less than 3 hours.
It is mostly linear, with very few choices to make throughout the paths.
The story is not that compelling, it needs a more depth and plot twists. The fact that it is relatively short doesn't help.
The stories of the individual characters (and even the sex scenes) are very much alike, there is not enough diversity. The story introduces some kinks, that don't come as plot twists.
The sex scenes are too static (there are basically two pictures per scene). There could be some rudimentary motion to sex things up.
There is no voice over acting. There are some sound effects, but not that special (sometimes they are funny though).

Overall, I changed my original recommendation, because of the kind response from the developers clarifying that there is NSFW content (I hadn't realised there was an add-on - note that if you play the game without the add-on you can't fast forward in the complete version) and because I understand they have just started to explore the gay visual novel genre.

If I'd put this game on a scale, this game is a meme one.

You shoudn't go into this expecting a tripple AAA title, it's not, it's a double AA, but a rather good one. The story line is deep, intriging and if you like such things will keep you interested. Combat is fun, the gun aspects can be quite handy and powerfull. There is abundant of enemies and bosses and alot of side quests to keep you busy. Choices matter and will affect you status with certain factions and friends which can generate nice perks. The one thing I see people said is don't wast your time on unnessary exploration and here I would aggree. The game doesn't reward you for this, there is enough open areas to explore, but maybe just for leveling up purposes. The side and main quests will eventualy require you to go through those areas. My advice would be follow the quests, get comfortable with your favourite companiens and assign them the best gear then you're good. Overall I would recommend it.",1,1718624663,0,0,7
7021,1467590,"While the promise seemed grand, the game just fails to deliver fun. 

The tutorial presents an overview of your cockpit, but I can't read anything from my 15,6"" 144Hz laptop screen - the UI is too small. 

The flight/physics model is bizarre for my taste. If you're an arcade pilot who liked Ace Combat, Project Wingman, or H.A.W.X. - try it with caution. An obscure game, ""The Tomorrow War (2009)"", has spaceflight that is more accessible. 

Something feels off for me, even after hundreds of hours in similar flight sims from Il-2 and War Thunder to Sky Rogue and The Brew Barons.

The biggest issue - I can't seem to hit anything. Bullets and rockets rarely connect and provide no feedback for the player when damage is dealt. 

The game is not there yet. 
I expected more from the 1.0 release.

7022,1467590,"I can't recommend this in it's current state, and not for fifteen quid either. There's some [i]incredible[/i] potential here, but it needs some work. TL;DR wishlist and keep an eye on, unless you can deal with the things below.

ETA: Steam doesn't seem to be tracking my playtime correctly - I've significantly more than the time listed.

[olist]
[*] Very little weapon feedback. It's almost impossible to tell if you've hit something or not. I strafed a row of fuel tanks with my machine guns and I couldn't tell if you if I hit them at all, if I totally missed, or if I did hit them and needed a second pass. A hitmarker for the guns would go a decent way to solving this. 

It's the same issue with guided weapons too - did my missile hit? Unless I can see the target go down, I have no idea.

[*] The gunsight is tiny. It does count gravity for you, which is cool, but without any visible tracers to ""walk"" fire into a target, anything but the high RoF default guns are really hard to use, even on ground targets. I'd love to see some work done here, even some alternate styles. Elite Dangerous (and I loathe to bring that up here) allows for the selection of leading/trailing gunsights. But even if nothing changes, you could double the size of the current one and it'd be too small. More visible tracers would be nice too.

[*] The scale seems... off. Ground targets seem too small, which seems to feed into the above issues with combat being difficult. Combined with the lack of visual clarity, enemy ground installations turn into a blob of HUD markers and tiny specks. Good luck picking out enemy AA installations or anything, because I sure couldn't. Targeting priority seems fine, but as before, enemy bases become a blob of HUD markers with very little way of getting useful information out of them.

[*][b]UI[/b]. It's full of scroll boxes, and yellow text in a typeface I struggled to read. I like the style of it, and it certainly matches with what the games going for, but finding out what a weapon does shouldn't be a chore. The ship selection could do with some kind of overhaul too. I'd love to be able to compare stats at a glance, or filter by role or something like that. 

Cockpit instruments have similar issues too, but overall are pretty good for the ships I've seen.

[*]More control options. I like the flight model as is, but controlling the throttle with a controller is a chore - I'd love to see auto centring for the throttle, like how [i]Ace Combat[/i] does it. To it's credit, everything is re-mappable, but custom deadzones are always nice.

[*] CTDs galore. I often have 3-5 CTDs before getting to the menu, which is never a good sign. Once I'm in the game, performance is great, everything runs smooth. It's just getting the thing started in the first place. 

[/olist]

I appreciate there's a lot of negatives there, but it's clear that this is a WIP that has had a lot of love and talent go into it. This is all my experience too, maybe I'm just awful at the game, who knows. YMMV. The dev's done an incredible job for such a small team, and I can't wait to come back in a few updates and see how things are.

-kept kicking me out of the settings every 10 seconds forcing me to go in, change a setting or two if feeling lucky, then close menu and repeat

TLDR: 
Siimi is a cute minimalistic puzzle game about Siimi who goes out on an adventure to discover her true ‘me’. 
What I really liked about the game is that under the cute graphics, there is quite a deep and relatable story. I would recommend the game, but only if you like the art style or the story. The gameplay itself is a bit too shallow for most people I think. 

All things considered I think the developers did a really good job, and they should be really proud of themselves for creating a unique game which clearly shows their passion and wish to improve the world.

Because the themes are so heavy handed and the puzzles so easy, I'd primarily recommend this game for children.The message is pretty apparent and starts to beat you over the head toward the end.

7048,1467810,"How many village houses by a river have you visited? How about this house here? Wanna see what's inside?

Well, this 'house' offers an uncommon approach to VN storytelling, where you don't have any specific protagonist or a single story. It is, in fact, a collection of random, disjointed events occurring in a particular Russian village, with no definite ending to conclude the tale. The tone is comedic and culture specific, but being familiar with the Russian rural reality is not necessary; still, it might be beneficial to grasp comedic undertones better. 
While this way of exposition might work well with comedy, the convoluted and mangled English translation surely doesn't. Yes, the atrocious quality of translation often strips off the necessary coherence required to understand wtf is going on. Oftentimes, for the life of me, I simply could not comprehend what the writer wanted to express. Hence, the comedic aspects were gone, replaced by an incoherent mess. This, imo, is enough to ruin most story-oriented games, nevermind budget indie VN.

As for the art, it certainly was inspired by anime style, but only to a small degree. It is much more aligned with the eastern European one. This can be positive or negative, according to individual preferences, but inconsistent and outright wrong body proportions should not escape criticism. The weird perspectives and unnatural poses presented by the character tachie also harm the visual allure. Budget title, after all. At least the quantity of 'frames' during H-scenes is above average at this price level. Also, all art is uncensored, and humorous versions of tachie add some positivity.

The music does not stand out either. Nothing grating to the ears, but nothing catchy or memorable, for sure. Still, the tracks and occasional ambient do their job sufficiently well. Don't have much to complain about here. It's just good enough.

No bugs encountered.

To conclude, the absurdity and stereotypes employed by the comedic would have been enough for me to at least tepidly recommend this title, but the horrible translation prevents me from doing so. Sorry, the comedy should be emanating from the story events, not from the ridiculously bad translation. 4.2/10

7050,1467870,"Mystery Case Files: Cross Fade is the newest game to bring back the Master Detective in a series that spins 22 games, not counting a small handful of spin-offs.  Does it measure up?  Let's find out.

Story/Plot:
Cross Fade starts on the cliffhanger the previous game, The Harbinger, ended on.  The Master Detective wakes up and finds out key moments of their past have been altered.  In order to save their life, and time itself, the detective must fix what went wrong, while thwarting some of their previous villains while once more.

Almost from the start, this is also when the story goes downhill.  Almost every 'novel' idea this game purports to do has already been done in the series, often much better.  Disruptions to the timeline?  Done that.  Facing off against old villains?  Been there.  It can be nice to revisit older games, but MCF relies on it to a criminal degree by this point.

This game's story has two big problems that I've railed on in previous reviews.  The first is the series really needs to decide what it wants.  Originally, the Master Detective was a faceless protagonist, but the fourth game revealed the detective to be female from the backside including hairstyle, and a couple spoken lines.  Later games allowed the player to choose a gender, or force it to be male.  This game goes the male route; frankly if they made the detective a genderfluid shapeshifter, that at least would clear that up even if I prefer the female detective.

The second is the retcons and plotholes.  These have gotten ridiculous, and especially noticeable to long time followers of the series.  Changing studios certainly hasn't helped; if anything, in some matters it made things worse.  

Central to a lot of these is the Delimar bloodline, and seriously, give it a rest.  In the early days, I used to like their appearance, but more often than not they are a guest star if not the central villain.  Any appeal is long lost, especially when it muddies the waters even further.  I mean, when Dr. Who is more consistent with their lore, then something is off the rails.

Beating the game unlocks a bonus chapter which gives you further details from a different character in the story as well as gives some vague hints what the next game in the series may hold. 

Visuals: 
I personally found the visuals in Crossfade rather lacking.  While they are serviceable for the story, nothing really stands out.  Of course, any paranormal story is going to rely on things being dark, but you could at least rely on a few backgrounds to really stand out in previous games.  None of that is here.  I wouldn't be surprised if the studio was only allowed a small budget, and would explain the visuals.  

Gameplay 
I think as you can tell, I'm pretty down on this game.  If there is any positive thing to it, it can be in Gameplay.  As a Hidden Object Game, Crossfade has elements of point-and-click, hidden-object screens, and minigames.  

The point-and-click is just that.  If you find an item, you put it in your inventory, then bring it out when you come across an appropriate situation such as bringing scissors to cut a rope.  Occasionally, you may have to fix an item in your inventory screen before using it, which at least adds one more layer to the game.

Hidden Object Screens are simply that; static screens where you have to find a number of items from a list at the bottom.  Most items can be found immediately, and disappear with a click, while others may have one or two steps to reveal them...such as breaking a mirror to find something hiding behind it.  Weirdly, I think Crossfade has the fewest number of Hidden Object Screens I've seen in the series yet.  

Finally there are the minigames.  These are a variety of small games which vary up the gameplay.  Some are logic puzzles, while others rely on you to click your mouse button in quick succession.  The difficulty of these vary, but veteran players of HoGs will recognize them and be able to get through them fairly quicly.  

Finally, if you do get stuck, the game does give you hints to find hidden items, or to skip puzzles after a bit of time passes.

Sound/Music: 
Though there isn't many spoken parts, the game does have voice acting.  Given how little there actually is, you would think the quality would at least be decent...but most of it is subpar.  There were a couple of times I thought they must have pulled someone off the street and given them a few quarters before sending them on their way.

There is also background music, and it is competent, but certainly nothing stands out.  I've seen games use royalty free music which was more memorable.

Difficulty: 
As with most recent Big Fish Games, you can choose your difficulty in Crossfade.  There is the normal 'Hard-Medium-Easy' settings as well as personally customizing it.  You can choose to shorten the amount of time it takes to refresh hints, or to skip puzzles, etc.  In this regard, I have to give it a thumbs up.

Extras/Achievements: 
Does this game have any extras?  As mentioned, beating the main game unlocks a bonus chapter.  Additionally, there are two collectibles; Clues and Puzzle Pieces.  Finding all of these gives a minor bonus at the end; finding all the puzzle pieces gives you a bonus wallpaper if you wish to use it.  Additionally, as this is the collector's edition, you have access to the music, minigames, etc. in a separate menu.

This game  has in-game achievements as you cross certain thresholds like finishing a chapter.  Unfortunately, there are no Steam achievements for those interest in such things.

Recommendation:
So would I recommend this game?  As you can guess, the answer is no.  Big Fish Games could remove this entry, and no one would even notice.  If anything, it is just another indication of how far the series has gone downhill.  At this point, the only thing that might help is to do a hard reboot on the series.  So why do I play it?  For some reason I'm now more interested to see how the series fails than anything else.

Is there any point I could recommend it?  I guess if a person wants to waste a few hours, and wants to take a stab at some of the minigames.  Even then, only get it on discount if you have money you want to burn.  Otherwise, I'd try something else.

So far almost nothing of a tutorial is there to explain  to the player how to do anything beyond VERY basic movement, let alone how to use any skills or abilities or even how to level up your dragon once it gains a level. Id really like to see this title develop further and get alot more TLC from the DEVs, as for now I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Until alot more updates are made if nothing else to improve basic gameplay and some basic tutorials (Descriptions are missing on most things). For not it is a thumbs down (Willing to change my recommendation when updates make improvements).",0,1607995521,14,0,45
7066,1468040,"Let's not get ahead of yourself here. This game has a great premise and frankly I felt for it. But nothing really gave me a clue about the poorly development of it.

You may see that I played for less than an hour. Who am I to judge? Well, a player that couldn't get on with the game as it is. it's not a beta, it's an alpha. Not far off the greyblock stage, but this time blocks have a simple texture on it that gives the screenshot illusion of being bad graphic done game.

But it's not.

My suspicions arose with the unity launcher, if it was done, why is it still there? But let's continue. The game starts with 4 choices of dragons, no intro, no context, nothing less than some flavour text that allows the player to guess four archetypes (sturdy tank one, glasscanon one, quick and frail one and happy go lucky with wolfs one). Nice. Then we pop in a vast plain with some trees and a dialog. it seems someone needs help. Who? dunno. where? dunno. How the fuck do I kill a bandit? dunno. let's try some gamer knowledge, right mouse click, left mouse click, do something? Yeah, somehow the bandits are dead. They were 'villains', trying to mug/rape/kill/sell parchements to an woman in distress, in the middle of the village. Why not, why the fuck not?

It happens that there is a F1 button to give knowledge of the controls, and some popup text (that I really didn't see the first time). The dialog is bad, but not in a cheese way bad. Just bad. And slow. Hopefully, there seems to be a bug because the dialogues make you unable to move, but if you ESC to menu and come back you can roam freely while the scene continues. 
So then I got some XP, and before I had time to read the tutorial text - that wanted me to invest those xp - I'm transported to another map. Kudos for the fast load, even if it's probably because the level is quite bare. Same thing, some blocking-dialog-out-of-nowhere and I should help the girl. Yes sure, where? I mean there is a minimap, but nothing on it. Until I stumble on some bandits, and died. To be honest I was not expecting 8 archers to kill a dragon. No problem, maybe I'm a dragon cub with a 60 years old voice. Let's try again...

And by that, let's restart the whole village scene and dragon selection from the beginning. No save? Ok, dev, that's a bold choice. New try, I got the gist of it. right click seems to do some melee damage (the icon shows fangs, but my dragon gives kicks with it back legs, which is cool and cute; but cool), left click is magic, something like a ball of whatever is my element. Where does it go? Dunno. no cross hair, probably in front of the dragon, but since it doesn't necessarly align with the camera; it's tricky. Anyway, village done, load done, xp spent, archers here I go. I don't did this time, but the day/night cycle surprises me. I didn't kill all of them, and their boss seems to be immortal; and know I don't see a thing. Well, I see my glittering dragon. So as a player I see even less.

I quit. And now a grumble here.

I like games, I like making games. But this is a shame, because the idea is sooo good. The potential is sooo great. It doesn't even have the excuse of first game, because it's a sequel. And doesn't have the other common excuse of early access. So, why ?

7067,1468040,"I'm sorry... I just don't like this. I'm a huge dragon fan and I'm pretty desperate for a game where you can actually be a dragon, but this one isn't it. I don't hate this game, but it's not really worth spending time on in my opinion. 

It's nearly impossible to see where I'm aiming, the targets are just too small, and the huge dragon is in the way, with the camera centered in the middle of the dragon's back. The ""first person"" mode is even worse, it's not first person at all and I could often see into the dragon itself. The gameplay doesn't feel rewarding at all, killing enemies and leveling up just feels... meh. I got the feeling that once I completed the first level or so I knew exactly what the rest of the game would be.

The graphics and voice acting are fine for what it is, I don't really have any complaints there. I haven't played enough of the game to say anything about the story, but that's not really why I bought the game in the first place. The dragon is always flying, you can't land and walk around. I wasn't able to figure out how to actually breathe fire instead of just shooting a tiny fireball, but that might be an unlockable thing, I'm not sure.

I thought the game would be open world, since you're a flying dragon and all that. But it's not, and that's really disappointing to me. I would have preferred an open world ""wandering"" type game where you fly around and decide what you want to do instead of being funneled into specific activities right away. It feels like despite being a dragon you have no real power.

Even for $10 this game just isn't worth it to me, and I'm really sorry to say that because I wasn't expecting all that much anyway.

Then you have to deactivate a forcefield to get a helicopter (which handles terribly and makes it fun and scary) fly to an oil rig, and kill a single person on said oil rig. Game over.

The commentary is speech-to-text. And there's bits of philosophy and social commentary which are completely stupid.

I don't know who Yepstein is. I've yet to meet/find him.

Either a secret lab, or just a sort of secret. (Still missing 2 achievements)

Open up the hatch and look around! Try not to get your head taken off by MG fire or explosions! Button up and advance, shooting at the enemy! Its all so good. Not only does it look great it sounds great too and playing with it all is so fun.
+Some single campaings, quick missions and you can use them online. Crew them with friends if you want! Similar to how you can pilot a plane while a friend uses a turret in here you can do the same. Drive the tank while someone sits in the gunner seat! Or just let your friend command his own tank while you command yours.

7116,1467121,"This was a first minute buy for me, as I just love the Hurricane. Unfortunately, the Russians didn't see it the same way. Imported through Murmansk and used to defend that port, they were seen as, too heavy, too slow and with a weak armament, unsuitable to be used as fighters, but they had no choice and eventually nearly 3000 were received, to be used to defend Moscow and Stalingrad.
If you want them for use in the RAF, you might be disappointed, as they don't fit any time frame, so only Quick Missions, are available.
I'm using it in Career mode B o Moscow, where you get the 12 x .303 version with over 4000 rounds. I'm peppering 109's with it, (don't forget to disable boost limiter in combat),  but when you run out of ammo, it turns round and chases you. Eeek, you can't run away! It works well against the 110, but the 109 F2/F4, is hard work. Don't use full power for too long or the engine will pack up.
1 year later, In the B o Stalingrad career, the Russians have ditched the Brownings and replaced them with 2 x 20 mm and 2 x 12.7 mm guns. This means that when you hit a 109, ( G2 by this time), it falls to bits. The 109, is much faster, but you can turn inside, ( be very wary of blackouts). Work on your deflection shots.
As an RAF pilot once put it, ""Any competent Hurricane pilot can defeat a 109"".
I've yet to try the 4 x 20 mm or 2 x 40mm Tin Opener versions, but the Hurri is superb and well recommended.

7138,1467200,"[b]soliterix[/b] is the perfect example of how not to release a video game (along with half the games coming out these days). despite much needed feedback for his previous tetris-like, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1213860]cut smash wrap[/url], it had no settings whatsoever, buggy controls, you name it. most 24-hour projects thrown together for a game jam run miles around such a thing, but after a bit more work that should've been done before publication, it's starting to resemble an actual product. still not something to recommend though.

this time [b]falling blocks are combined with solitiare rules[/b], with the occasional joker dropping by to clear a single tile. points are awarded for simply placing anything anywhere, more for creating a full set from ace to king of the same suit. solitiare rules are now explained in the game, but [b]putting together a full set from ace to king of the same suit won't work if there's another card next to them[/b]. in my case, nothing happened with ace to king and another ace, all the same suit in one line.

[b]the music's pretty good, and that's it for the positives.[/b] graphics would be servicable, if not for some [b]really dark backgrounds[/b], and of course there's no brightness slider, nor a way to turn off background images. some settings got patched in, so the game can be quit now, there's info about non-rebindable controls and a full screen toggle with a resizable window, but still still no separate audio toggles or volume settings, just 'sound on/off' that toggles all audio and a single volume setting. no setting to remove the completely unnecessary timer either.

not sure what [b]the developer's continued aversion to the enter key[/b] is all about, in a game played on a personal computer with a keyboard, but it sure is annoying that it doesn't work properly here either, just like in his other game. it both opens and closes the pause menu and can't be used to select anything anywhere. 'z' and 'c' are the designated keys, but even those don't do anything when it comes to toggling audio or full screen, only arrows work there. mouse does too, but who plays tetris with a mouse?

so the game still has a long way to go, and it's just not an enjoyable experience to begin with. all you can do is go for a full set horizontally, all 13 cards of the same suit next to each other, and even that's limited, as described above. some [b]alternate, customizable game modes would be nice[/b], like matching 3 or 5 of the same suit, color or number.

[i]~Emily Thornberry[/i][/h1]

[b]Steam[/b] is a great store. You like video games? It's [i]the[/i] place to be. Unfortunately, [b]Gaben[/b] and Co are doing pretty bad job on fighting scammers. Not like they don't try. Quite the opposite. Ages later, but we finally got “games” like [b]Grind Zones[/b], [b]Journey of the Light[/b] and [b]NASWAY[/b] removed. Unfortunately, the scammers simply outnumber the good guys. And even though a lot of us are doing a good job reporting such “products”, there's still heck of a lot of scam in [b]Steam[/b]. I mean, look at the dude who calls himself [b]NL Studio[/b]. He makes, like, one or two “games” every month. Every... bloody... month.

But well, that's how things work with this kind of scammers. Free tools like [b]Raycasting Game Maker[/b] (the old free tool that lets you make your own basic [b]Wolfenstein 3D[/b] clones) allow scammers to make new shovelware product every day. I mean, seriously, all you need to do is to is to change a couple of sprites and draw a few labyrinth-like levels in the most basic way you can ever imagine. And if you're an a-hole like [b]NL Studio[/b]? All you really need is enough content to make a couple of screenshots for [b]Steam[/b] store. Feel free to check my reviews of [b]Last Escape[/b], [b]Planet Station[/b] and [b]Gold Dust[/b] for more info, but long story short, the dude just steals some sprites design from popular old games like [b]Catacombs 3D[/b] and [b]Duke Nukem 3D[/b], add a couple of enemy types, a couple of weapons and... that's it. Please, welcome – a new “game” from [b]NL Studio[/b].

But you know what's worse than a scammer? A scammer who got the taste of impunity. [b]Gaben[/b] didn't ban [b]NL[/b] dude for a few months? He ([b]NL[/b] a-hole, not [b]Gaben[/b]) became even more shameless. As usual, in this “game” we've got only three levels that you can beat in only a few minutes (seriously, from five to ten minutes, that's all you need to beat this “game”, or pretty much any other “[b]FPS[/b]” from [b]NL[/b])), but like in [b]Gold Dust[/b], [b]NL[/b] MOFO didn't even bother with keys. So, all you need is to find an exit. Unlike [b]Gold Dust[/b] (which was broken) you can actually finish this one, but again, there's no story (not even a basic text at the beginning and the end that we usually get in this kind of “games”) and after, like, five minutes of gameplay you'll just return to the title screen. All [b]Raycasting Game Maker[/b] technical difficulties included. Enjoy.

So... yeah. There are good developers. There are bad developers. And there are scammers. Shameless scammers with only one goal – to get that extra buck from you. Sell [b]999[/b]+ games for a buck and baby, you're a rich man. You want to know more about [b]RGM[/b] games? Go to [b]IndieDB[/b]. You'll find a lot of way better and completely free stuff there. The stuff that people made because... you know. They actually wanted to create something and share with the others. Even though the initial tool was way too dull and way too limited. But this?

The game is literally unplayable because you can barely aim.

If you're just looking for a senseless way to blow some time, the cheaply-produced first person shooters out on the market are certainly an affordable way to go about it. This is, of course, a cheaply-produced first person shooter.
The essence of this game is that you are magically alive in a prison cell, and you will be given a pistol for some reason, and you're to use it shooting inmates to get to... somewhere, for some reason. The game has all of three levels, with all of three weapons and a total of two enemy types, the fat guys and the traditional inmate who has a shiv. The guns are a single-shot pistol, a fully automatic somethingorother (it certainly looked luck a gun, of some type) and a buzzsaw that costs ammo to use (they all cost ammo to use). You can regain 5 health per green vial picked up towards your maximum of 100 health, and you have all of these things about you as you adventure through the corridors of an indoor environment.
Oh, and everyone is always facing you, they have no backsides, just their front side, facing you. And they seem to know how to chase you down wherever you go. Like. once they've spotted you, they will always know where you are.
Still, for $0.99 top, and 10-20 minutes of play time (remember to save when you've got full health!) to get through it to the ending (where a bright light appears then you're magically returned to the main menu with no explanation), this game is weird, and has no story. Also it's full of inmates with shivs who will strive to their end to stab you to death.

I'll be honest, I found the game entertaining... but when it comes down to it I don't think *anyone* else I know would willingly pay a full dollar for this, they'd probably immediately demand a refund upon viewing how cheap and meaningless the game is. So, on account of what I think others look for in a game, I had to say I don't recommend it. I don't mind it, for real; I won't be asking for a refund, and I was actually laughing my ass off at the antics that we're going on... but if you really need something to laugh at you can take an incredible game like Dragon Age II and play explicitly the sarcastic dialogue choices.
This game is an empty hollow shell, there are only three levels, it is hilariously cheap, the most common way to end up dead is being repeatedly shanked to death, you are the only person with a gun, the game is not hard to beat, you are the fastest unit in the game, and there seems to be an incredible presence of toilets throughout the game's maps.",0,1620864480,19,0,63

Sadly the difficulty is really unbalanced and the controls are the cause of many, many deaths and just don't feel right.

So Imma keep it short and sweet. It might sound negative, but I actually just want to give a short concise constructive critique. And also, I'm gonna give it an overall positive review despite it's major issues. Not on part of any bias, simply because i think the game is playable in it's current state... Just extremely unintuitive for the most part... Unfortunately(or perhaps fortunately if you look at it the way i choose to look at it. 

THE REVIEW:
This game has... Potential. It's fun, it's fast paced. It's probably one of the coolest and most easy to get into ""puzzle"" shooters I've ever gotten in to. 
In a weird way, I feel like this game shares some common DNA with a game like Hotline Miami or another of that sort. Just endless trial and error until you finally hit the nail on the head and get it perfectly right. 
That stuff is fun. 
BUTTT 
I think what this game lacks is proper controlling. Here's what I mean: Say you're flying your ship. Everything is mouse based. So you move the cursor up a little ahead in a certain direction. You lock your velocity with right mouse(by holding it no less). You go to shoot with left mouse(keep in mind your velocity is still constant). You stop shooting. You release right mouse. However. You've had a lapse in judgement. You release right mouse after shooting only to realize that by aiming in and shooting at said target... You have now shifted your velocity to light speed and are now hurdling towards and asteroid or turret ship at the speed of FUCKING LIGHT...

Now I don't know how much sense what I wrote just made. But the thing is. Aiming. Shooting. Velocity control. And rotation. They don't all ""fit"" on the mouse. 
At LEAST, they don't ""fit"" intuitively on the mouse. My issue with this game - being the control scheme aforemtnioned - is also a bit of a non issue. Because whilst unintuitive and I sort of kind of hate it. It's also LEARNABLE. And if it's learnable... It can be mastered. 

I guess. If this game had a more conventional and evenly divided out control scheme like say movement and velocity control with WASD + SHIFT and shooting being relugated to the mouse quarters... This would probably be a damn good intuitive puzzle shooter.
BUT. As it is. It's a damn good UNINTUITIVE puzzle shooter. 

So yeah. I wrote this kind of quasai while i waited for the last few minutes of my youtube video to upload. So sorry for mistakes. But i hope i made enough sense. Miziziziz. If by happen chance you're reading this, I love your content and your games. Keep it up.",1,1606291896,21,0,1

7171,1467390,"I recommend this game for the price -- feels really polished for $4.50AU and has a really decent amount of content, and a system of movement that's a joy to control.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get very far with this game -- the game is stacked against you significantly unless you're already a master of its movement systems when you begin. There's a joy to the way it controls, but it is really restrictive in how you use that movement set. Each mission is a test of patience and repetition rather than an engaging fight.

The main draw of the game -- the fantasy it tells you it will fulfill -- is that you are a ruthless hunter that mercilessly outmaneuvers your prey. The game doesn't fulfill that fantasy, unfortunately. A few annoying inconsistencies make your ship way, way worse than the enemy ships and put you at a major disadvantage. Every fight is a desperate, repetitive fight for survival against overwhelming (and extremely unfair) odds, where you are constantly running away and memorising movement patterns just for the chance to get a few shots in against an opponent that vastly outperforms you in every single way.

1. Enemy ships take about 10 shots to take down, and yours only takes one. You can change this in the settings one way (reduce enemy health to just 1) but you can't change it the other way (increase your hit points so more of your mistakes are forgiven).
2. Enemy ships are unaffected by asteroids. If your ship so much as brushes against one, you instantly die. It can be really frustrating, especially early on when you're getting the hang of the movement system, to constantly have your momentum cut short and have to restart when all you want to do is to fly around and bounce off stuff. It's especially egregious when an asteroid is placed right next to your ship at the beginning of the level so you die within an eighth of a second. I think the asteroids should behave the same way for the player that they do for the enemy.
3. The turrets fire really fast and really accurately. If the maximum possible speed is 100%, they will hit you if you're travelling at about 65% speed or less! The only way to kill them is to zoom past them while locked, but the asteroids in the way make this really difficult and precise and fiddly, which means you need to slow down to get your bearings, which mean you instantly get killed anyway. The turrets feel like a Stage 20 enemy, not a Stage 2 enemy. They are insanely difficult for how early you encounter them in the game.
4. The first boss fight is against a rival fighter pilot. I expected this fight to be a fun back and forth where the pilot takes a few shots at you and you have to dodge out of the way and return fire, but instead he's way more of a suicide bomber than a pilot. Like all the other ships, he's unaffected by asteroids, he has near-perfect accuracy unless you're moving at at least two thirds your max speed, and he wins by killing himself. It doesn't feel like a dogfight between equals at all -- it feels like you're reliving Groundhog Day in Pearl Harbour. The only advantage you have is that you have unlimited retries. Though, I suppose he does too.

Again, for its price, highly recommended and a lot of fun if you have the patience for it. But in its current state it doesn't fulfill the sci fi dogfight fantasy at all, at least not for me.",1,1606183206,22,0,73

Right off the bat, the game is not about you but the people your various PCs will meet across their journeys, and the world that those people live in. This is a great setup, except for the fact that there's basically no depth to any of it. Petria - the fictional country the game is set in - is so vague that you're basically required to assume ""oh okay, this is an analogy for [AUTOCRACY OF YOUR CHOOSING]"" and roll with it. There's no proof that the current leader is tyrannical (except voiceover and VERY hamfisted dialogue) until a few hours in, and there's no proof that the alternative candidate for the election is any better. As far as the state of the country is concerned, you basically have to take the game's word for it, which is very bad for a game so overtly about political intrigue. This terrible set-up leaves no room for engaging character interactions, which is 80% of the game. NPCs are one-dimensional and poorly voice-acted, to the point of caricature. The climax of the game left zero impact on me.

That basically only leaves visuals, which are also lacklustre. I would describe it as the worst parts of Firewatch and Fortnite combined. The game is set in 1996, but thematically is a mix of the 80's, 90's and... I don't even know, that's how inconsistent it is. The one concession that I can make in this regard is that the UI is pretty, and just enough info without going overboard. 

I have a bunch of other issues with the game, but they're all spoilers so I won't write them here. You'll have to play the game if you really want to know, maybe you'll like it more than I did? As for alternatives:

7183,1466640,"This game is one of my favorites of all time and I just wish I could play it for the first time again. There are multiple endings so I’ve played it through a number of times, but the gameplay overall is similar each time.

It truly makes you feel as though you’re on a road trip through the desert and it’s the most amazing feeling. The storyline is gripping and the characters are interesting so I’ve spent hours playing this game in one sitting. As someone with ADHD, it’s not easy to pull me into a game like this. So if you’re easily distracted, it would be one I recommend. 

Choices matter in this game and there are some puzzle like aspects. But overall, it’s not too difficult. Anyone at any skill level will enjoy playing this.",1,1721661434,2497,0,5

7186,1466640,"Poorly written, I only finished it because I wanted to see if I could get the worst possible ending for all characters because I disliked every single one of them. Especially Alex. You know that super annoying kid genius archetype from movies? The one that acts like a smartass 100% of the time while adjusting his glasses and starting sentences with ""according to my calculations..."", that's Alex. I've seen many other people online wishing they could just tell him to piss off during every interaction.

Characters' actions make no sense. The player is just randomly pulled into seemingly important events by adults where characters put their lives (and potentially fate of the country) into hands of some random teen passing by, this approach is used to over and over to the point of absurdity. Most of the time player's presence isn't even needed to proceed the scene, but the game acts like you're absolutely essential. Details on the political regime are not there at all beyond ""red bad and imprisons kids"". The ""blue"" side's candidate is not explored whatsoever, she is just a placeholder with no personality, I have not seen a single bit of info about her aside from general ""she is against everything bad and for all good"", we just know she exists and that's it, we do not hear her voice, we do not read anything written by her. This game feels like it was written by some hipster teens that never lived in an actual tyranny and just wrote a fantasy about having a cool road trip. All the adult characters act so stupid and just plain helpless throughout the story you will wonder how they even lived up to their age.

Which is all a damn shame because the core mechanic of the game with branching storylines and seeing same characters from different protagonists' perspectives was great in theory, I absolutely loved the idea and was very intrigued after I got arrested in my first run and realized the game actually continued with consequences of my actions after that and not just restarted.

7199,1466640,"Cliché story, could've been written by a 13 year old. I couldn't care less about the characters since none of them are likeable nor interesting. The voice-acting is mediocre at best, feels like they got their voiceactors from Fiverr. The dialogue options lead to the same thing, its also hard to mess up an option if its a life or death situation. I would describe it as being like Until Dawn but for 7 year olds and the options reflect that. In some missions they have an unnecessary amount of deadtime of just walking. The game is really repetitive, making you play as ""different"" characters with similar paths to Road 96.

I do, however, like the artstyle, because it resembles Firewatch. But don't ever compare it to Firewatch. It is leagues above Road 96 in its story, voiceacting, design, music and gameplay. Dont buy this. Just buy Firewatch instead, much more of a enjoyable experience. Or any of the Telltale games if you want the option-based part. Their games are much better too.",0,1720381682,425,0,4

Cute art and characters, wholesome, WLW, relaxing and relatively short.
Plus, Viola reminds me a lot of Princess Tiabeanie from Disenchantment.

Also, I always had an inkling that [spoiler]Sakura MMO and Sakura Knight were part of the same universe and happening at the same time, so to receive the very obvious hint towards in this game was pretty cool for me.

7202,1466680,"Sakura MMO Extra is a nice addition to the series, bringing in a somewhat new challenge for Viola and her party. In this part we take on the quest that our beloved Guild master gave us, Working as maids in the new Maid Café! 
with a lot of trials, new maid dresses, and a touch of humor, We start working at the maid café, distributing papers in the city, and experience the first challenges. The café is though more visited than though at the very first, which shows them quite easily how weary a true maid job can be.
Very fast the party shows pain in legs and feet and exhaustion. 
The café becomes more and more popular, also thanks to a new so-called attraction, which is none other than Viola, being a wanted sadist, trampling over clients wishing to be abused.

After a few days, Viola overhears some gossip from 2 ladies, saying a feared pirate got caught and will be executed. Viola, usually not concerned by this kind of gossip shows then interest and has to realize it is truly connected to her old crew member Bonnie. What will await her? What will the crew do and undergo to save her? now a run against time has started to rescue Bonnie and have her life spared.

Overall thoughts:

This addition is rather unexpected for the series but it is still well done and as humorous as the precedent games. Doing a maid Café and working in there to ""kill boredom"" is a nice setup which I did enjoy the read. 
Short as it may be we still have a few different routes and endings depending on the choices and also some ecchi artworks as well. But as always in a  sense, the  uncensored patch brings us a better view, but I am still missing some truly interesting yuri artwork where we can  see more of the girls

7219,1466680,"An extra story in the MMO series universe where crew gathered to serve tea and cakes. Real life maid cafe can be rather cringey, is this one as well?

As easy to imagine the focus of this 'story extension' is a maid cafe, ...and that's about it. There is almost nothing else to see here, no action, no twists, no surprises. It feels all too monotone. Slice of life can be served in interesting ways but this one does a poor job with it. Scenes often drag unnecessarily, having little to no substance. I felt bored more than once, unfortunately. Cute maid outfits and cutesy acting can be a bit over the top at times. Also, not enough yuri in a yuri title in my opinion is a crime. Even at this budget cost I expected more. Three different epilogues extend the gameplay a little but they're all short so not by much. Lengthy summaries of the past events were unnecessary here. One of worse stories among Sakura titles.

Art is, as usual, pretty good. The artist here is Inma, the same as in other parts, so don't expect much more than ecchi. Barely any nudity present, and unlike in typical VN fandisks, there is less lewdness than in the main 3 parts. Quite a of CGs were present in the previous games. Bit too much copy-pasting for my taste. Also, why Aislin lost her cute ears and Neve has no tail on one of her CGs?

Music was simply copied from the previous games in the series. Still fine but lack of anything new is a bit disappointing.

No bugs encountered.

Overall, a bit disappointing Sakura MMO 'fandisk' with uneventful, dragging story, copied CGs and music. Even at this budget price and with all the cuteness I still cannot honestly recommend it: 3.5/10",0,1627410148,569,0,237

7221,1466690,"Sakura Succubus is a series of 8 games (and maybe more will be released in the future) about a loser guy who suddenly ends up with a harem of beautiful girls. While the series didn't grab my interest, I decided to check out this particular installment since I love holiday/beach themed VNs. Note that there's no need to play the previous games as the premise is explained and the characters are presented at the start (I suppose that's true for the other parts as well).

Well, this one didn't turn out too interesting either. Most of it is about the girls bickering with one another, occasionally having group sex with the guy while still bickering with one another, and just being difficult in general. It gets exhausting really soon. If I were in the protagonist's shoes, I would have eloped with Cosmos to a deserted island right at the beginning; the other girls can kill each other for all I care. There is no relaxing or dreamy holiday vibe, and only a couple of short stereotypical scenes take place on the beach, the rest being set in nondescript indoor locations (kitchen, bedroom, bathroom).

There is no semblance of a story, but who needs that. At times you are faced with decisions; two of these will lead to long adult scenes, the others may unlock CGs or have no effect. Note that as with all Sakura games, the adult patch has to be downloaded from an external location; check the forums. The graphics are nice.",0,1709758449,321,0,177

It adds a new necromancer playable faction, which emphasizes staying as small as possible while maximizing their ability to spend a new resource, essence, to dramatically increase the effectiveness of their few fleets and stations.  Growing too big (I'm talking even going past 100 AIP) is extremely dangerous as the necromancer, due to the new enemy type which exists as their counter, the templar.  The templar's power scales at an extreme rate once your AIP gets too high, which almost always leads to certain doom.  If you can survive, the necromancer can eventually turn the tides against them if they grow so huge that the templar's fleets can't rush the phylactery to death anymore, but that's an extremely difficult task even with a pile of allied minor factions to help wear them down.

[h3]Original review[/h3]

This isn't too expensive for the type of game it is, and probably regarding the work that went into it.

However, I cannot in good faith recommend the game in its current state.

It is fun, and pleasant, half the time. That is, when you do not get monstruous frame drops (that are unaffected by the quality settings). [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/1467020/discussions/0/2974028351332042096/]The problem has been reported on the forums, and even some RTX 2080 Ti owners complain.[/url]

In addition, the game isn't too polished by itself. The textures are low def and blurry even in high settings, the models are not very detailed, and the gameplay feels clunky too often for a freerun game. This title should have been released in Early Access in my opinion.

Devs, fix it, because it is otherwise a good game, and would sell very well at this price point.",1,1607279102,81,0,92
7259,1467020,"This is probably the most conflicted review I've ever given. 

I've played this game for a grand total of 40 minutes, but that's all it takes to beat--it's not a long game. It's got a lot of variable routes and creative movement mechanics, giving it a good deal of replayability despite the becoming-tired parkour gameplay model. It's got a lot of achievements for achievement hunters to have fun ferreting out. But it's...buggy. Portions of levels sometimes stubbornly refuse to load. Enemies teleport or float across the map. The main character's arms turn into spaghetti when he's grabbing onto a ledge, sometimes he gets stuck between walls and jitters off into infinity. Sometimes, when you respawn, the level forgets to respawn with you and you die again. There's a lot of bugs in this game.

The world Aefen Fall depicts feels [b]almost[/b] as fully realized and fleshed out to move through as the world of Dishonored, which this game feels very strongly inspired by. If anyone's looking to scratch a dieselpunk or even steampunk itch, this might do it for you. But I say almost because I find the main character very flat and unbelievable, in his mission (which we aren't really given much insight into) his voice acting (which wasn't horrid, but wasn't that great) and his writing (which is just short of good and nuanced.)

Aefen Fall is a tale of two feelings. A coin with heads and tails very equally weighted. I recommend this game, for three reasons.

The first is that this game is absolutely gorgeous--from a visual and a storytelling standpoint. The visual design is top notch, and I want to know more about this world. What happened to turn London against the alchemists? What is Abadel trying to accomplish? What happens to him [spoiler] when he's surrounded by Wardens and sets off an alchemical circle beneath himself, and the game suddenly cuts to the credits? [/spoiler] This is an intriguing premise and a fascinating world and I want to see more of it. As frustrating as it can be to play, I want more.

The second is that this game was made in under a year by a student team. Holy fulminating spirits, Batman. Bugs or no bugs, this is what I would expect from a triple-A studio for their first alpha tests. Watch these people. Support these people. They're going places. I dearly hope they have future plans for the Aefen Fall property because they could make it into something truly spectacular given some more time and money. So make that possible. Be a part of that future. In a world half-choked by big companies out to make a buck, support people who want to make a game.

The third is that you get what you pay for, and more. Seven bucks, I've eaten McDonald's meals that cost more than that, which were gone much quicker, which I enjoyed much less. This is an experience worth paying for, and hopefully (if their bugfix team is currently active) will be much more so in the days to come.

If you've got the cash to spare, if you like Dieselpunk, Steampunk, and fantasy elements, if you want to run around rooftops being pursued by robots who want to steal your magic stones, buy Aefen Fall. You won't regret it.",1,1613465446,40,0,10

7266,1467020,"This game has a lot of pros and cons, but I still recommend at least on sale. But even at full price, it's cheap, and has replay value, especially when the cons get addressed.
Pros:
- FANTASTIC visuals and art design!
- Fun gameplay design, that allows opportunities to mix things up if you want to.
- Many routes, for high replay value, and to challenge yourself with the fastest shortcuts.
Cons:
- MANY moments of bugs with clipping, getting stuck, and inputs not working very well.
- VERY abrupt and unclear ending, though it was expected for a student project with a time limit.
- Heavy performance issues, resulting in inconsistent framerates.

Like I said, most of the games issues have the potential to be patched. Patches have already been made before, so there's chances that they'll patch it more, which will make the game MUCH more worth the purchase, especially if they can fix the performance.
I truly hope this game does well enough for them in sale to maybe make a full game on this and expand upon it, as there's a LOT of potential here. Even if it's taking a lot from Dishonored, it's still has enough different to be its own thing.

UPDATE: It's been almost half a year since the last patch, and over a month since we heard any update about the game. I believe that they're still working hard on fixing these issues, and I hope the game is not abandoned. But keep in mind that it's unlikely you'll see an update for a LONG while, if any at all.
So, when getting this game, expect leaderboards crashing, levels not unlocking after beating the game, platforming bugs, and especially inconsistent performance on any setting or system (as the devs mentioned they can never fix that aspect of the game unfortunately).",1,1616035449,259,0,216

7268,1467020,"It's a good little Dishonored-meets-Mirror's Edge game. It's thirty minutes long (on your first playthrough, no less) and is extremely buggy/rough around the edges. With that said...

It's a game that takes good concepts from other games and executes them well enough here. The platforming is satisfying. The powers are neat. And the way respawns work is beyond cool (other games should pay attention to Aefan Fall's respawn system). Plus, there's an achievement named after Sonic and a ton of other little video game easter eggs, if the community's screenshots are anything to go by.

The game is poorly optimized and can barely manage 40 frames consistently on an RTX 3070, sometimes textures won't load in and you'll have to reload checkpoints, most of the animations can glitch out depending on when and where you activate them... again, it's very rough. But if you have a strong-enough PC to brute-force the game to run decently and you want to try out something neat that some students made, this is a good time.

Adding a quick edit onto my review (which was already a thumbs up): it's really cool how many branching paths there are in levels. The developers clearly knew what the players' instincts would be and it results in levels where if you see an area and feel the need to go to it, you probably can. That feeling of freedom is really amplified by the wonderful skywalk power. Another nice thing is the bit where you draw your own magic rune. It's a really simple, tiny little thing that just multiplies some light inputs from the player, but it makes you feel like Doctor Strange.

7272,1467020,"Caveats:
- The game is buggy and glitches. A LOT! And the devs will not (be able to) fix it.
- The game is short. I have no idea how you can spend 45 minutes in a playthrough as stated on the store page. Realistically it will take you around 30 for your first run with failing a lot of jumps and not knowing where to go. Subsequent runs should scratch on the speed run goal time of 15 minutes.
- You can get Mirror's Edge and its sequel on sale for the full price of this game. (At least in Euro.)

That being said, I still recommend it. The developers were pretty upfront about the state of the game, its shortcomings and their lack of support. It's a student project by graduates. Would have been nice if they released it for free, sure, but the price is cheap enough to forgive the lack of polish and content, especially on sale.
It's just short enough to give you quick fix of parcour gaming which we are definitely lacking. The game offers enough alternative paths and some tricky sections to give you some replayability and keeping it fresh. Though the incentives to do so are lacking. The speedrun achievement is obtained fairly easily and leaderboards are non-functional to the point of crashing the game when you try to view them.

But that's not the least of its problems. The hit detection on edges or poles is buggy, leading to randomly failing jumps or getting stuck in the geometry quite regularly. And a lack of key rebinding or at the very least the ability to invert axis in a first person game is inexcusable today. I hope the developers take this point to heart for their future projects.

All things considered, if you have already played and enjoyed Mirror's Edge it's definitely worth checking out on sale.

A word about the achievements: they are grindy. You will need like half a dozen runs to get most of them. The accumulated sliding time - and for some weird reason the running distance - will take a lot longer. Personally I hate it when developers set these kind of unrealistic goals or totally lack awareness of how much replayability their game really offers and turn it into a mindless grind for achievement hunters.",1,1617810900,3072,0,37

Graphics: 6.5/10
There's nothing wrong with any of the graphics, but there something that just feels off. The look of the Victorian Era Steam punk London feels good and fresh, yet it also cheap in a way. Graphic glitches and strange animations seem to creep in to take this down notches. I didn't get upset by any of it, but don't go in expecting to be wow'd either.

Gameplay: 6.5/10
This is where i'm torn. The game has a great potential. Let me sell it for you. Mirror's edge meets steam punk London with a dash of Harry Potter Wizarding. The potential was great. The execution was rough. The game only lasted about a hour for myself and even then it was wearing thin. It almost felt like a mobile endless runner, mixed with horrible glitches and moments of bad hilarity when my character would make a jump then start climbing into the sky. The spells added in to make game-play more than just a runner, are a novel idea. Crystal bridges can be formed, time can be stopped and all of it done in a way that makes you think this game could of been made for speed runners if done right. I think and feel this was almost like a demo game or college project that got a little bit off the ground and would have loved to have seen this with a bigger budget and more robust system carved out.

Story 4/10:
You're Alchemist, but the city thinks that bad so you're going to go take down science and technology? There was a story there, but it felt off and was hard to follow. I'm sure if I'd of taken time to listen more as the main character talked and spouted exposition, but I was too busy running and praying i wasn't going to glitch through the floor.

Overall 6/10:
I really would love to see something like this in a bigger scale refined and with a bigger budget. It's just a half baked game right now with a very quick ending that doesn't explain anything.

This game has been created by students, and for a work of a bunch of students, it's an alright game. It looks good, it plays relatively good, story is garbage ngl. Biggest problems are bugs, optimization and length. It is a very short game, on my first walkthrough I've finished it in about half an hour. There's also an achievement to finish it in 15 minutes. And here comes the second problem - bugs, lots of them. If you won't stuck in something or if you won't be thrown up in the clouds - consider yourself very lucky. And this is in a half-an-hour-game. Let's assume you're fine with short story and lots of bugs, but you'll need a pretty fast PC to play this game. Much better than the minimum requirements for sure, because damn it's fugly on low settings (and it doesn't help framerate much) (UPD: I should also say that it does look great on ultra settings). RTX 30 series might work for you, but I can't tell for sure, don't have the money.
In the end it is, basically, a tech demo made by students. A pretty impressive tech demo, considering the circumstances, but it is still just a demo.

I appreciated the non-linearity and the respawn animation looked cool, but that's all I really enjoyed about it.

The big stickler is that I found it to run pretty horribly.
For a parkour game the spense of speed is really lacking, and the clamber/mantle animations feel like momentum killers.
Speaking of which, the main spell you'll use, a floating platform creator, will *Always* cause the protagonist to snag off of it, killing the momentum once again.

You'll encounter a handful of mechs. Presumably intended to spice things up, but they're all too easily outpaced and have a high tendency to derp out and get caught in a loop of falling off edges, respawning, then falling off the same ledge again, etc.

To top it off there's a segregated final section. It's really small and you just have to avoid spotlights which is easily done my going around the room's perimeter, then a cutscene triggers and uh, that's it.

Got a fair way through until one area would not open. This problem has previously been reported on the forum where the devs responded that they could not duplicate it. One player's suggestion was to delete the game files and restart the game. I can't be bothered doing that; the game is not that interesting.

The Good:
- Free
- Significantly expands the game

The Bad
- The new playable characters are just Albus split into two girls, one with a sword and a second with wind magic. There are minimal additions and changes to Albus two classes, seem completely redundant
- Introduces some very annoying enemies like crabmits
- Even more grinding for level and masteries

The Ugly:
- Bianca is obnoxious
- DLC's main story revolving around the new characters reads like some melodramatic cheesy soap opera with plot that goes nowhere
- Axes, Clubs and Pistols remain completely useless since both new characters use old weapons which makes their legendary variants pointless

I just bought it on the Summer Sale for real cheap, and now that I have experienced the entirety of the game loop, I am glad I did not spend full price.

The first comparison that comes to mind is that this game is extremely simplistic Minecraft.  You gather a resource here, carry one item at a time, crawl at a snail's pace to Machine #1, wait there because if you leave to do anything else you'll lose the resource, move that one product to Machine #2, play the waiting game again, then deliver that item to the shop area.

-increase character speed
-allow character to carry more than one item
-allow the player to change keyboard controls

My favorite aspect of the game is once you clear a level you can either pick from three items that either give a stat bonus, new attacks, or fully heal. This gives you the ability to make very diverse character builds, while also adding an edge of difficulty since you cannot heal if you decide to improve your characters build after each level. 

Two Die rewards players that make calculated decisions to defeat each enemy without taking damage. This can be done with any class by either killing an enemy before it gets within range (Mage Class), increasing armor/using block skills (Warrior), or attacking and running out of range of an enemy (Rouge). 

I also like that once you clear the ""last level"" you continue through levels that get progressively harder without getting the option to heal or improve your character.  To conclude this game is very addicting and offers lots of ways to play the game without it ever feeling stale. This game is certainly worth your time and money.

7330,1466260,"A lovely hidden roguelite with a neat twist at more than affordable price point.

You choose a character out of 3 standard classes (warrior, rogue and mage) and embark on a quest where all encounters will be played through dice rolls. Despite dice playing the part it's very controllable, because you can improve the odds to be more favorable through character upgrades, temporary boosts from special actions and perform multiple attacks per turn while engaging in and disengaging out of combat at any time, provided that you have enough movement points left. Positioning relative to enemies is very important.

Progress is made through encounters, each a static screen filled with monsters you need to clear. Lean design may give an impression of a very simple game early on as reaching and beating the only boss at 10th encounter is fairly easy, but that's when things get serious. Until that point you can choose upgrades for your character, or healing, after each successful encounter. After that point you can no longer upgrade or heal and it's down to making the most out of your current build to make it as far as you can. The farthest I've made it yet is 34th encounter and I can assure you, it gradually comes down to one wrong move and you'll meet your demise. The deeper in the run you are, the further ahead you need to plan.

Also, as you can imagine, there is a TREMENDOUS AMOUNT of RNG involved (seriously guys, so much RNG!), so you need to go into this game ready for some insane streaks of both good and bad luck.  The game mechanics are basically ways to influence this RNG, but I think itemization could be more distinctive, and characters should start with more skills off the bat or at least you should be able to achieve this with some metaprogression.

Jennifer Wilde: Unlikely Revolutionaries is an excellent Point-and-Click Adventure game set in 1920s Western Europe. Clearly inspired by Jazz Era literature and influences of the time, this game does an excellent job at establishing mystery and intrigue. 

[b] Art: [/b]

The art-style is breathtaking - clearly showcasing the passion and attention to detail that the team had when crafting this game. This holds true to the UI which manages to present as non-obtrusive and immersive in the case of the journal/case-solving segments.

Additionally, the stunning backdrops of Paris and many of the other locations in and around Jennifer Wilde: Unlikely Revolutionaries really help to immerse you

Lastly, the cutscenes and general mise-en-scene is spectacular. Once again you can tell how much passion has gone into this project.

[b] Gameplay: [/b]

The general gameplay loop consists of talking with other characters and gathering evidence to paint a better picture of the incident that occurred - whether it be finding an item, completing a puzzle, or solving a murder case. You'll often find yourself jumping between many different locations and finding creative ways to solve a puzzle.

[b] Other Notes: [/b]

Jennifer Wilde: Unlikely Revolutionaries is very short at around 3 hours of game time. However, each of those hours was spent thoroughly enjoying the game from it's brilliant art-style and UI, to the well-crafted story and game mechanics.

[b] Conclusion: [/b]

Overall, Jennifer Wilde: Unlikely Revolutionaries is absolutely worth picking up. I have never been a massive fan of point-and-click adventure prior, but this game has certainly ignited my interest in the genre. Great work @Outsider Games, you all did an excellent job.

7358,1466350,"A wilde Oscar appears: The Game.
The art is really charming and the developers really did try something new with the tired genre when it came to clue collecting and assembling, which makes it that much harder to criticise the game for falling short in everything else.
The biggest elephant in the room is Oscar Wilde himself. He easily overshadows everyone else no matter where you put him and it does no service to the writing when he is the cleverest thing about it. Even then he speaks in his own quotes making him more of a broken reflection. He appears suddenly and inexplicably at the beginning, seemingly as a surprise even to the protagonist as to why he is specifically the one to insert himself into the narrative. There is a flimsy justification in the dialog, but honestly there is only one true reason - the writers just really like Oscar Wilde (And why wouldn't they, he is fabulous) and the faster you accept that the more likely you will be to enjoy the rest of the story. Suspend your disbelief extra hard. Beyond the clever quotes he will be just looming over you like an avatar of authorial appeal. The most loquacious ghostly pokemon. You won't be creating any sort of rapport with him as a protagonist.
His presence does establish the story as a queer one at least. So do we do crime? Do we at least eat hot chip and lie? We travel a couple of countries trying to find out why our dad is dead and there is a paranormal conspiracy going on, but it won't be explored in any detail. Comparisons to Blackwell series immediately invite themselves, except those are all cheaper, fully voice acted and tell a way more complex story, whereas here we don't make it far past the premise. Jennifer doesn't encounter adversity in any significant way, she just comes to the right place to make the plot happen to her.

7360,1466350,"Started playing ""Jennifer Wilde: Unlikely Revolutionaries"" and finished it in 3 hours!
This intriguing murder mystery is the interactive version of an Irish comic book series published by Atomic Diner. It features Jennifer Chevalier, a young woman in Paris, faced with sudden tragedy when her father is killed. The shock of this trauma wakes her dormant special powers: she sees dead people. And none other than the ghost of Oscar Wilde is adamant to help her uncover the truth!
The beautiful black and white comic book style artwork pulls you into this game, a cool mystery story filled with murder, conspiracy and intrigue keeps you playing, and the gameplay, although there's not much of it, keeps you entertained while trying to figure everything out and reach the conclusion.
There are two main parts to this game. First of all, you'll have to switch between Jennifer and Oscar as two playable characters, pretty much in the same way as you play the ""Blackwell"" adventure game series. Because ghosts tend to gain access to places physical beings can't (or at least not unseen...), and also they often have peculiar influences on their environments which could be used in your favor.
Secondly, Jennifer keeps a notebook in which she gathers clues. You'll have to find some items to help you with some puzzles, but the main part is reconstructing events, putting clues together, through the sketches Jennifer makes (oh yes, she's an artist and can draw very realistically) to uncover what actually happened.
The story will take you from Paris to London and finally to the great library of Trinity College in Dublin (I went there once, it really is awesome!) You'll spend a lot of time talking to living humans as well as ghosts, piecing everything together so you can figure out what the next course of action should be. There are a couple of tricky puzzles involving tarot cards, electric lights and morse code which you might not immediately figure out.
The game isn't voiced since, well, it's essentially still a graphic novel, but luckily you can adjust the speed at which the text changes so anyone who fancies themselves an actor can go ""wilde"" with the French, British and Irish accents.
It's a short game, there's really not much to it, it's more stylistic than a flashy adventure game, but it's good for 3 hours of fun in between some harder games. And it actually made me want to read ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" again...",1,1705393215,188,0,83
7361,1466350,"Scores points for being very different. Combining Oscar Wilde with the roaring 20s? Black and white graphics? The actual gameplay is rather weak for a Point-n-click, but it's sufficient. The story is very condensed, but could use some more fleshing out, especially to properly introduce the Irish characters (keeping this vague to avoid spoilers). I also feel that Oscar's character oscillates too much between lovable dandy, hint dispenser and telling Jenni to be more careful. If you're using such a well-known figure from literary history you should really make use of all the information available about his character to have him be a more nuanced and fleshed out part of the story.",1,1705183418,265,0,53
7362,1466350,"I could probably just write idk and post it as a review and get my prize for the shortest-but-not-completely-meaningless review. Because I really dk. There are many small annoyances which add up and make the game not as enjoyable as it could have been. That is, my vote is definitely Recommended because the game is fun to play, those annoyances don't make the game frustrating or unplayable. Was it a satisfying experience though? I'm not so sure about that.

There's a lot of jumping around. You combine two clues, and instead of giving you a chance to examine the new clue or the new chain of clues, the game closes the sketchbook, teleports you to another location and initiates a dialog with an NPC (and a couple of times I thought I was still using the sketchbook and instead skipped a line of a dialog).

Figuring out the clues is not difficult but can be a bit confusing because the game may say that Jennifer needs to talk to an NPC when in fact the first necessary action is generating a new clue, and also because there is one system for using items (with its own minor annoyances) and another slightly different system for clues.

There are also puzzles based on interacting with NPCs and with objects in the environment, the puzzles are not bad, but there's only a very small number of them, and there are a couple of bugs breaking the puzzle logic (one of the bugs has already been fixed).

The graphics are definitely very nice but mostly static. The text can be magnified, but then it starts to look blurry and can go outside of the screen bounds.

The story jumps around quite a lot too. Oscar Wilde quotes himself and makes comments about fashion and Irish mothers, but it doesn't feel like his character is necessary or is well-integrated into the narrative. Idk.",1,1667254880,302,0,42

7364,1466450,"After having played Puzzle - LINES AND KNOTS & enjoying it immensely buying this was a no brainer. As soon as I spotted it I tossed it onto my WL & waited like an eager bunny for it to be released. I bought this game in under a minute of it having been released & absolutely enjoy every minute I spend playing it. This one I am taking slow in the hopes the Dev will have more coming before I finish it. The 1st one I devoured like a ravenous beast! This one I am forcing myself to slow down because I enjoy this style of puzzle a lot & there are very few of them on Steam.

This game has a very soothing, calming vibe to it despite it being a puzzle game. This is a game that I don't rush, taking my time enjoying each puzzle as the process of working out the solution to every one just flows naturally & before you know it you have ended up completing way more of them than you thought. This is a game where you just get lost in it, more to the point the time just fades away & you don't notice that it has because playing this is like enjoying a fine bottle of wine.... never rushed, always enjoyed & always coming back for more when you do finally manage to tear yourself away! 

I highly recommend adding this as well as the 1st one to your cellar to be enjoyed at your leisure when you want time to disappear / have the time to get lost in / carried away by being immersed in this particular cup! Cheers to the Dev who is a gem!

7374,1466610,"IMHO, I can recommend this game with two caveats. The first is that this product is not for players new to wargames. For those gamers, Panzer Corp 2 might be a better, albeit more expensive, choice.

For experienced players, the game comes closest to Matrix Games' The Operational Art of War III-IV, although CAOS is much simpler to pick up and play.

Here's the short-list of positives for this product:

1. The OOBs are exhaustive, and the historical units will be familiar to wargamers. The NATO symbols are a delight.
2. All the nitty-gritty details for a moderately complex operational wargame are here, including Air Units, Supply, a Comprehensive Orders Menu, Zones of Control, WEGO turn playback (10 ""impulses"" shown per turn) and a multi-page combat resolution display showing lists of units involved in the action and combat losses.
3. The developers continue to add the equivalent of free DLCs worth of content, including the latest WW2 Operation Husky campaign in Sicily.
4. The AI is definitely up to the task. In my experience, it may be getting a little bit of ""help,"" but that is hard to determine, as so much is going on under-the-hood, with the movement and combat calculations hidden from the player in fog-of-war.
5. The latest version of the game, and the Operation Husky add-on, appear bug-free.
6. Many aspects of the game are text-moddable, and I have yet to ""break"" the game after seriously messing with the text files!

Using the Interface
- Right-click on a unit or stack on the map, and an OOB breakdown appears below. Choose the entire stack or highlight an individual company/BN/Regiment below by left clicking. Then *left-click* on a destination on the map, and right-click to exit orders for that unit.
- When deploying units at the start, or during a game (reinforcements are a new addition to the sim), left-click on the OOB box below to highlight the unit, and then *drag* it onto the map on the highlighted blue squares. 
- Selecting the Air button in the lower right corner of the screen allows one to choose bombardment/air support/recon and doing the left-click to select the specific target, unit to be supported or recon square.

(Check out the images shown on the Steam purchase page to see the plethora of information available on the various unit screens.)

For those who want to ""tool around"" and are familiar with the Cheat Engine application, it's easy to search for (and increase) the number of build points on the deployment screen using the ""double"" value-type search option. I am happy to help anyone who needs it regarding use of Cheat Engine when playing against the AI. This allows one to deploy an unlimited amount of friendly units at the start, or during, the game.

And finally comes the second caveat, which applies to some players: All the stats and formulas appear to be there, but the visual resolution of combat is minimalist in the extreme. Even the old (but great) HPS and John Tiller games featured a combat resolution box during turn resolution, as each attack was made. In this game, you will have to search for the results by using the replay feature and selecting the units with ""combat resolution"" icons over them.

Personally, graphics and whiz-bang resolutions come a distant second in comparison to historical fidelity, lots of unit stats and formulas, etc. But I still found that the game is a bit less ""exciting"" than it should be, considering all that it is simulating.

For $20 USD, it is still a solid buy for most wargamers, especially because the devs continue to work hard and release free content. It's also ""different"" enough in its own right to find a place with a 1,000 other wargames released over the past 40 years!

7377,1466610,"[h1]Bottom Line:  a must-have for any lover of sophisticated wargames.[/h1]
  
This is one of the most interesting wargames I've seen in many years. It's deep, detailed and sophisticated. I have 10 hours in and have barely scratched the surface. (Honestly, you definitely need more than 5 hours game time [or even 5.6, for that matter] to render anywhere near a credible assessment of this game.) The OOBs alone are worth the price of admission. The main units of maneuver are regiments (and specialty battalions) which themselves are composed of two or more battalions which themselves then consist of individual pieces of equipment -- individually rated tanks or halftracks or infantry guns, arty pieces, trucks what have you. These can be detached and combined in any way you like. For example, in a recent game, I combined, during play, a German motorized MG Bn with a Motorcycle Recon Bn, making a mobile recon unit that packed a pretty decent punch. Not something I even dreamed of doing in my first 5 hrs of play and it'll take 5 hours more just to begin to explore the full implications of this system (I'm thinking of composing various American armored division Combat Commands, for example). 

The WEGO system is fascinating and the game facilitates a careful perusal of each turn, which are broken up into 9 pulses each of which can be examined in detail and in depth. The 3.6km ground scale offers a wide range of possible random battle scenarios. The devs are adding historical scenarios as we speak which is going to put this game over the top. As it is, I rate this game a must-have for any lover of sophisticated realist wargames.",1,1660316327,2328,0,12

4. Need to add puzzle and detective elements to the gameplay, but easy to solve. 

5. Need to ability to change gender for protagonist to let user choose male or female 

6. Is there an ability for user to equip and use shield?

7. Why not a skill where user can quickly dig and tunnel underground and jump out the ground behind enemy for surprise attack or escape?

8. Why not the ability for protagonist to ride eagles, horse, ride cows, etc for that time period?

9. Why not add decision making tree in the dialogue of the main character with NPCs to different storyline outcomes? E.g. going the path of evil and be able to learn evil skills from evil sects? or going the path of good to be able to learn skills of the light from righteous sects?

10. Why not review elements of popular western open world games and add to your game (check patents beforehand)

11. Once you have a solid basic engine, you can then use that base for all other storylines and focus resources on advertising, marketing, graphics development and overseas marketing to chinese markets in the other 200 countries.

7424,1466070,"Please note, it's not my intent to make the developer feel bad about his game, but I was very miserable playing it, so much so that I could not take more than 30 minutes - obviously, it's not much of a review of the game, it just got so bad that I had to quit. To give at least some positive vibes, I was kinda interested in the character, even though the voice acting was not great, I would be interested in the story if the game was formatted differently. Just out of respect for indie devs, I am not going to refund it, take my money, but I think I am entitled to at least have some fun talking about my frustration. 

I was constantly fighting controls, camera angles, sticky zones, tunnel vision, and puzzle logic;  I even hurt my pinky holding the run button the entire time while trying to rotate. The character will often go in the opposite direction, and no my controls are not reversed, I press left and he drifts right, I press right he goes left. On top of it, I am confused all the time, I can't tell if the puzzle is working properly or not, I can't tell if there is a glitch, you zoom in on certain areas and there is no indication of me interacting with it when I hear a sound. Then I pick up an object with the same button that I use to open doors, I clearly need to take it out of the room, but when I open the door he drops the object. And if that wasn't enough, you are given too many areas to explore with bad cameras, it's hard to follow any kind of pattern, there is too much going on, too many things to consider, there is no way I am wasting my time backtracking this game.

I didn't get far enough to evaluate the narrative, and I don't want to critique the voice actings in the indie game too much, but even the volume is a problem, I would have to change my computer sound up and down to properly hear the voice acting. 

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

So 3 things to consider

The puzzles and clues do not click with me at all. I might click on an object, I hear sounds, but nothing changes, so I don't know how to interpret that. You give me access to a lot of space with a lot of navigation time, I would have to do a lot of backtracking just to test a theory of why something works or not. Like, don't give too much at once, if you making a puzzle game, make sure the player can reasonably put things together, don't make it too convoluted.

The cameras and tunnel vision are pretty bad here. Again, you really have to take into consideration how the player experiences your game, maybe you just need to design it so the view does not change the entire time, focus on simple level design, don't make it complicated if you can't polish the navigation.

For the voice acting, I can't even hear it in some places. I don't mind the voice or anything, whatever, but if you can't keep the volume consistent, just don't do it, many devs make good narratives with text and some mumbles. 

[b] Overall Thoughts: [/b]

That was honestly painful. If you want to make an atmospheric narrative game, maybe start small, focus on the story, don't try to do anything crazy with puzzles and exploring, do less backtracking. Do one thing right, instead of doing everything wrong. Maybe with a ton of polish, it could be okay, but it's a big 'IF' right now. Sorry, don't take it personally, I just don't want to be so miserable playing games.

7425,1466070,"This game.... in simple words.. painful. Unfortunately i thought it would be a fun indie game to checkout but after playing it for about an hour and getting nowhere I am calling this a bust. The camera and motion controls are lacking. Interacting with objects is awful. Its makes noises like you have done something but nothing occurs. There is no clear direction and although in most games that take that approach this is a subtle suggestion on flow to the story where as this game has not flow at all. Honestly its like painful. I don't want to crush developers but in this case it needs some TLC. Def not trying again.

7432,1466090,"[h1] Utterly Pointless[/h1]

[i]Gothic 1881[/i] is a very short (less than  2 hours) RPGMaker game that really fails to deliver anything meaningful. For less than $2, I did not expect much, but I have played games that are less than an hour long that have left more of an impact to me than this game does. The ideas are definitely there to be elaborated on, but the overall execution of the ideas is really lackluster and bland. If I had to be perfectly honest, this feels like someone's college project.

[b]From here on out I will go in depth criticism with spoilers.[/b]
[spoiler]
[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ The health items being period appropriate. The fact you use an opium-laced tonic and morphine to heal yourself is quite clever.
+ There are a lot of things to examine and some of the observations are intriguing. Generally they do a good job at showing you how backwater and depressing the town is while also adding in clever historical details to give the player an idea on what kind of town they've come to. 
+ The use of a grayscale pallet is interesting aesthetic choice to give that feeling of being in a 1881 town.
+ The magic meter is now a bullet/ammo meter. Very good idea since you use a gun as a weapon. 
+ Interesting ideas such a an epidemic that is fabricated, and the subtle Lovecraftian vibe of ascending via higher knowledge and seeking the unknown. 
+ The philosophical gravekeeper. I like how he questions the idea of death because of his profession. It makes sense given how many dead people the guy sees. The fact that one of his kids died also adds to his cynical nature. 
+ Immediately after setting foot into the town, you already know something feels ""off."" The people act strange, and everyone seems to be paranoid and manic about something.
+ The sprites and portrait art are well-done. I especially like the main character's battle sprite. Something about a chibi mustache man pleases me. 
+ Prompted savepoints before areas where you can potentially Game Over is a nice little warning and feature. Given the fact the main character cannot level up or grow stronger, this small saving grace at least warns the player that they are entering a dangerous area.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Stupid and pointless RPG-style combat. The first enemy, a werewolf you encounter, is numerically impossible to kill. I tried multiple times and used up all my healing items to no avail. I figured that you're probably not meant to kill it, so I just ran around it. The only other enemies you fight are regular wolves, and they are ridiculously easy compared to the werewolf. There are no bells or whistles to the combat--just attack, guard, and use items. 
The battling serves absolutely nothing to the plot and exist merely to waste your time. 
- The grayscale, while interesting, makes it hard to see certain environmental items. Some chests and paths are hard to distinguish at times from the background. 
- Inconsistent container looting. Some things that look capable of looting are not clickable whereas they are in other rooms/squares. 
- Treasure chests respawn either empty or with only 1 bullet. Again, what's the point? This mechanic exists to waste your time. 
- Totally and utterly nonsensical story. For a game that tags itself as being ""Story Rich,"" there isn't a whole lot of actual story going on in it. In fact, it doesn't seem to know what the hell it wants to be. It advertises itself as being a Gothic horror story, but it really doesn't know what kind of horror it wants to focus on. For example, there is a werewolf but it serves absolutely nothing to the plot. The writing seems to hint at first that there is a werewolf curse potentially going around town, but this is not brought up in the least--only hinted at with the wolf sounds and said werewolf (which is impossible to kill).  The entire plot is nothing more than a waste of time. It leads into making you believe that there's possibly some Lovecraftian craziness going on, only to pull perhaps the stupidest twist ever which is that you're actually just in a virtual reality world and that nothing you did actually mattered in the least. Even the antagonist you were investigating the entire friggin game just up and disappears at the end of it, and the game just [i]ends.[/i] No questions are answered. 
- Absolutely no character development except for maybe the gravekeeper guy. Everyone else might as well be cardboard cutouts. 
- Seriously the ending is just pathetic. Even the explanation of why you're in a VR world that resembles a depressing 1881 town in Germany makes no sense. For whatever reason, you are just some guy who wanted to escape into a VR world for the past 10 years only to wake up not remembering anything. The world, which is actually 2081, has been poisoned by some kind of failed attempt to stop global warming and now the nitrogen levels are too high, making it impossible for people to breath properly. The game never explains why the main character dreams all this in the VR world or if the VR world he inhabited was shared by anyone else that's a real person. After finding out this ""big reveal,"" you click on a tablet and the game ends with no fanfair. In fact, it just says game over with the credits. 
- Very unremarkable soundtrack and sound design. The soundtrack is just sad piano songs on loop and they don't have any memorable melodic structures to be worth listening to on their own. The sound effects are just typical stock ones you'd find in a game like this. 
- The mice sprites being completely impassable and blocking your way. This goes for the sheep too. There is no fun in waiting for a sprite to move on his animation just so you can leave a corner of a room. 
- I genuinely can't tell if this game is meant to just troll you or if it's meant to be taken seriously. 
- Lack of achievements or in-game menu that tells you if there are more than one ending. At the time of writing this, I was only able to find two endings: the one where you die by the werewolf or when you just quit the game at the tablet.

edit: 
the game becomes more frustrating as time goes on while not getting harder at all. It introduces a bit of new objects, but also adds the repeat mechanic: a level where you see a button, and get the cube for it near the end, forcing you to repeat the level all over again (without any way to do it faster). It also makes you pay more attention to the different switches, making you repeat the entire level if you miss one or softlocking you in some weird area, forcing you to restart manually. 
This might be why many players leave the game before reaching the end, that can be seen with the achivements getting rarer even if you get them just for completing the new mechanics level. All of these look like they were added just to make the game feel longer and don't really add up to the fun.

[b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] is a jigsaw puzzle game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Arrange assorted pieces to assemble an image. [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] is a basic jigsaw puzzle game. There are eight puzzles to choose from, of varying difficulty. The image of the completed image is overlayed onto the playing area -- that, combined with ""snapping"" puzzle pieces make [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] a breeze.

[h1]Story[/h1]
There is no story (and I'm not making one up).

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen and user-interface are appealing and simplistic. However, the user-interface is slow to respond -- I found myself furiously clicking as I waited for it to respond my requests. From ""Settings"", you may adjust audio preferences. There doesn't seem to be any in-built way to window the application. There is no gallery. To review CGs, you must always complete their respective puzzles. The puzzles themselves and the playing pieces are stylistically [i]broken,[/i] but there is no way to see the artwork without the ""broken"" filters. 

[b]- The Goods-[/b]
There are eight puzzles to see, each featuring an anime babe. There is no nudity, I did catch some [i]mean underboob![/i] The artwork is decent, but you could find similar content with a quick Google search. If you're here for ""mature content"" (as advertised on the Steam Store), [i]you're going to be a sad camper.[/i]

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I don't recommend this game, even if you're in the market for discount jigsaws. I don't ask for much -- all I want is a functional, responsive game with a good selection of artwork. [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] is the minimum of functional. There's no difficulty settings or ""save"" functionality. The UI isn't snappy, and there's no proper gallery. The artwork isn't bad, but it's both generic and not well suited for a widescreen monitor. My expectations for [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] were already rock-bottom, but this game couldn't even reach the bar.

7459,1465260,"Cybernetic Fault, The Divine Invasion, Euphoria: Supreme Mechanics, Dofamine.   Now this. This is the fifth CyberCry Creators game to launch into Early Access this year. The publisher promises that all games will be released in 2021. But well-founded doubts arise. Each game a new game from this studio is getting worse and more and more raw.

The protagonist in this game is a girl. But this is just an obscure figure in a hoodie. With the same success, there could be a kangaroo under the cape, you would not notice the difference. But in the description of the game it is mentioned as the main advantage: A girl with a sense of humor. Her sense of humor, by the way, is completely useless. Probably, it was funny in the developer's head, but it is unlikely to amuse you. I do not know in which class the student should study, what would make him laugh at the mention of a shot in the kneecap of a robot from a stun gun, even if he had played Skyrim before.

The game begins in a prison cell with no furniture other than a neon grille and a prisoner. You have to run with the stun gun to the end of the corridor, killing the security robots and escape from the prison.

The stun gun hits several guards at once, which at first glance seems to be an advantage. But you have to shoot by running up to the robot quite close. At the same time, robots do not walk alone and have time to shoot at you well before they die by your hand. Because of the cover, the stun gun does not fire. Probably from my own considerations about a fair fight. I see no other reason. He shoots ugly not reliably. On the contrary, robots rarely miss, shoot from afar and do not hesitate with it. I never got to the end of the corridor in an hour of play. Despite my initial curiosity, I decided not to do this anymore. Another game delayed until release. 

I am disappointed again. It is not clear why the game settings become available only after you start playing and do not click on the escape, and not from the start screen. The graphics are dark and not impressive even at epic settings. From the pros, I see only localization in many languages. It was probably difficult to translate all the wooden jokes into 12 languages.

Firstly, it's crucial to ensure that she has a strong moral compass and understands the potential consequences of her actions. While her weaponry may be impressive, it's important she uses it responsibly and for the greater good.

Next, it would be beneficial to encourage her to collaborate with like-minded individuals or organizations that share her passion for solving global problems. By working together, they can pool their resources and expertise to achieve more significant results.

Additionally, she should focus on developing her problem-solving skills and staying informed about current issues. This will help her identify the most pressing problems of the 21st century and come up with innovative solutions.

It would also be wise to urge her to engage in diplomacy and peaceful dialogue whenever possible. While her rockets may be powerful, finding peaceful resolutions should always be the first priority.

Lastly, a sense of humor can be a valuable asset in navigating the challenges she will face. Encourage her to use it to diffuse tensions and bridge divides, but remind her to be mindful and respectful of others' boundaries.

In conclusion, this girl armed with rockets and a sense of humor has the potential to make a significant impact on solving 21st-century problems.

-This is less of a city builder and more like a basic resource-balancing puzzle in the way it functions. 
-There is no explanation of what to do or why. You just have to click around until you figure it out, which wasn't very engaging. It runs smoothly, so if you're looking for super simple, it might appeal.

7533,1465350,"Simplistic and structured, not immediately intuitive but it grows quickly. Sublime track, promotes a soothing easy-going city tile puzzle builder. My first attempt almost cleared the top hurdle. Just a few thousand short of the needed city value. I am pretty sure I could pick-up this spare. Controls are sparse, it isn't Maxis after all. But they did well for what you have, and for the price it's worth showing the dev some love for putting forth the effort, and producing a meaningful 'polished' product. If I had a gripe it would be the controls, you can't move forward without following the cursor, but I was soon accustomed to using the bound vertical keys. Just move around holding Q and it's good, or look up just above the horizon, so you don't have to back up and adjust every so often. I'd say try it out, and it's easy enough that a young mind can find joy in it, and possibly learn with deeper meaning. It's a good starting point for game exposure. In around 30min I was able to discern some of the patterns, which make them easy to explain and contextualize, and nearly completing the game.

More importantly, the solitaire board levels take center stage and have a great flow to them... When actually working. And there in lies my main frustration. In almost every solitaire round I encountered a card that was glitched and could not be removed, forcing me to back out of the level and start it over again. I also experienced lag or sputtering when clicking any objects or switching locations. Finally, and the last nail as it were came in the form of system crashes if the game ran for more than a half hour or so at a clip. I verified the game and even reinstalled it again but it was to no avail, as the problems still persisted.

DigiMight really doesn't do a bad job with their +1/-1 solitaire games. Although their games can be mechanically quite similar in terms of abilities and board obstacles, I can count on them to produce a quality product.

[b]Detective Notes[/b] also includes hidden object levels interspersed with the solitaire, which is a fitting touch for a detective story. However, you return to the same locations far too often to search. While most of the items are easy enough to locate, some of them are quite difficult. Luckily, the game includes a hint system that can guide your eyes to the correct location.

The story was more interesting than the story in most games of this kind, although [spoiler]I suspected Lily of deceit far in advance of her brother Mark.[/spoiler] The visual design of the environments and characters was impressive and served to increase my immersion into the tale.",1,1643035889,524,0,861

Each HO scene is book-ended with story pieces around your main character and their sibling trying to solve the mystery. 

The game is cheap and you'll get around ten hours of play out of it. It was a fine calm little timewaster in-between RPGs and other games.

[b]Bubble Girl[/b] is a lewd “bubble game” where you shoot and match colored-bubbles to collect lewds!

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Unscramble an image by swapping tiles around. It’s kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, but a bit easier: you don’t have to contend with irregular shapes. There are twenty puzzles total, starting with four pieces and ending with sixteen. If you can’t be bothered to solve any puzzles, there’s a “cheat” button at the top-right corner of the screen.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
I’m not one for ASMR; I’ve never listened to ASMR, and I don’t understand the appeal. I imagine. . . ASMR is supposed to be relaxing, yes? [b]I was more scared than relaxed[/b] as I listened to the “ASMR” [b]Hentai ASMR[/b] has to offer. You know what I heard? Insects. Big, mean insects — cockroaches scuttling around me, with some bored woman sighing and breathing by my side. I heard grit and sandpaper — between the lady and abrasive sound, I felt as though I was going to be sliced open on some operating table. [b]All I heard was stress.[/b] Well, until I heard the sound of marbles (or was it a pen against paper?) I could hear that all day! When the steel wool hit my ears, I had enough ASMR and muted the game.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen is eh, but the user-interface is somewhat attractive. From “Sound” you may adjust audio preferences (including the dreadful ASMR track.) There is no gallery, but puzzles can be instantly solved using a “cheat” button. The CGs can’t be fullscreened (and if they could be, they wouldn’t fill a widescreen.)

[b]- The Goods-[/b]
There are twenty static CGs total, featuring artwork from FlowersXL — I recognize that name from Deviant Art! There’s lots of [b]thicc[/b] waifus to see, but their faces are cut-off (and there’s no nudity). If you like lingerie and swimsuits, there’s plenty to see! I wonder, will there be a nude patch released in the future?

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Though [b]Hentai ASMR[/b] is a functional game, I’m going to disrecommend it. The difficulty is laughable, and there isn’t nearly enough gameplay for the price. I get it — it’s a budget hentai game, but there’s [b]cheaper[/b] hentai games with better content. The artwork is awesome, but where’s the faces? I know the artist, FlowersXL draws damn [b]good faces[/b]. . . where’d they go? Honestly, I just recommend looking up FlowersXL and checking out their content. The “ASMR” wasn’t to my liking (though in the game’s defense, I don’t like ASMR in general.) If this game interests you, I’d wait for an update or two (or a good sale!)

7568,1465390,"Well, it was only $1.19 when I bought it, and I got what I paid for.
...Practically nothing. 
The triggers are just generic triggers you could find on one of many YouTube videos, you can 100% the game in half an hour (which I did), and the ""beautiful art"" hardly even qualifies as ""Hentai."" Honestly, you could just play a jigsaw puzzle while listening to some better ASMR and you'd get more enjoyment out of it, not to mention a significantly better selection of triggers. 
I didn't even have to play the game with one hand, either. 
0/10, would not recommend, ever. Unless there's some secret that I just clearly missed, and I don't think there is, then this game isn't worth the time or the price.

7581,1465410,"Overall, I quite enjoyed this game as one of the first true homages to Kururin around. The music and visuals are quite good on the whole, and I found the level design to be nice as well. 

However, I think the game is held back by some really odd gameplay issues that might not even matter to most players. For example, as I got into the later levels I noticed how hard it became to precisely move the ship since there's this odd deadzone on the analog stick (I was playing with a DS4) that doesn't read your inputs until the stick is moved about halfway from neutral.

I also found that the lacking ability to speed up the ship's rotation speed (a la Kururin Paradise/Squash) was a weird omission, as there would not only be a lot of seconds you could shave off your best records with this feature, but plenty of creative technical exploits players could find. Similarly, I thought it was a bit strange that the starting point and healing zones weren't considered safe and give you penalties for trying to make any adjustments to your angles.

Besides that, there were a few occasions when my collected ship parts suddenly disappeared from my save altogether as if I had never gotten them at all. This didn't seem to have any affect on my best times or no-damage runs however. And as a more minor issue, the stage select has a problem where if the mouse is left on the screen while using the keyboard or analog stick (at least I think that's the cause), the cursor gets stuck on the wrong page and mucks things up.

Other than that, I found this game to be quite a good start for modern-day Kururin, although it definitely needs some work before it can be considered ""excellent"" or before I can really recommend it. Thankfully, the developers seem to respond to feedback quite well, so my hope is that this review is obsolete soon enough.",0,1611613711,132,0,4
7582,1465410,"The theming is cute and inoffensive, and the stage designs don't seem too bad - It's the controls that stop this game from being a enjoyable Kururin-inspired homage. There's such a huge amount of deadzone with the XBONE analog stick, that you need to hold the stick halfway up to get any input read at all, which makes finite adjustments neigh impossible to perform. It also took me 30 minutes to find out you could use keyboard to control this game, as there is easily HALF A SECOND of delay in your inputs being read. I have no idea what the logic was behind that. Keyboard doesn't seem to work in the menus either. I also noticed a group of glitches in the menu's where things were highlighted that weren't selected, and if you backtrack through the worlds your player icon disappears and you have to fumble your way around in the void.

Hopefully the devs fix up the glaring control issues and the glitches present. As a huge Kururin fan and speedrunner of the series, I love seeing games that attempt to emulate/build upon the Kururin formula. Sadly, this game just misses the mark in its current state.",0,1611174293,42,0,1

 The visuals are basic and the gameplay is annoying. I cant say any more than that. I uninstalled after half an hour, but I will periodically check in on the game because there is potential there.

7624,1465500,"Hero Puzzle is a mobile app that's been dumped on Steam as if it was a real PC game (it's not)... it's a cash grab from greedy mobile devs.  This mobile app is a ""pin puller"", that is to say you put your finger on your iPhone screen to drag pins and various other objects around, which releases the potential energy of stacked up objects (traps, piles of coins etc) which then fall down with the usual bad iPhone physics that we all expect from shovelware dumped into the trash end of Steam as a nasty cash grab. 

Actually the only interesting part about this mobile app is the rather large number of paid fake reviews from compromised Steam accounts, as the developer breaches all Valve rules to manipulate the review score for this mobile app. 

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

While there are options to change the resolution for the mobile app, all this does is scale up the simplistic 2D art assets used to make the mobile app, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the lacklustre 2D visuals.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the mobile app is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Hero Puzzle has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the mobile app absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for stealing a chest, trivial to achieve, but less than 2 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the mobile app.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

The mobile app never really caught on with the millions of gamers on Steam, with a very low peak player count close to launch, and then just a handful of players launching this mobile app every couple of days.  This is undoubtedly caused by factors such as those raised in this review.  It's always helpful with buying decisions to consider how popular and successful the product is, and unfortunately while this did accumulate a few participation trophy reviews, overall, people just aren't using it.

[b][quote][url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/01/18/steam-takes-down-art-of-stealth-after-developer-posts-fake-reviews/?sh=750e13e12354]Warning: Review Manipulation![/url][/quote][/b]This mobile app features a large number of fake positive reviews from accounts known to be in the business of review manipulation/paid reviews.  They're all written in either Russian or broken English, appear at almost exactly the same time, very shortly after the mobile app launched on Steam, all have a direct Steam purchase of the mobile app, and the accounts are used consistently to write fake reviews for asset flips and other cash grabs/scams.  The ""Positive"" review score on this mobile app should be disregarded due to this blatant, unethical review manipulation.  This is done to deceive and scam gamers into paying for a bad product.

So, should you buy this mobile app?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $2 USD, on app stores, it's free. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay TWO BUCKS FOR A FREE MOBILE APP just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this can be played free elsewhere, is priced to insult and gouge PC gamers, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.

7629,1465610,"10/10 arcade soccer perfect. This game strips out all the extra fluff (and rules) that bog down regular soccer games even more so than Mario Strikers to hone in on the fastest action soccer you could want. The game is played on a single plane with relatively simple controls for kicking and boosting but enables some stylish flourishes as you weave over or under the opposing team.

Reminds me of NBA jam to an extent, the gameplay nails short bursts of fast and furious action (no catch up mechanics though). A bit like a fighting game rather than a sports title given how the games kicking and basic ball juggling system works. The AI will destroy you if you don't get good in a hurry but it is definitely beatable. Fun little single player story mode which uses its less realistic approach to go places

There isn't any internal online support and the game is quite twitchy so I'm not sure how well it would work but the AI matches should satisfy at the price point if you can't get some games with someone local.

My only critiques are maybe having a button to manually swap characters, maybe to the one closest to the ball, as a player ""dash dancing"" with the ball between two of the opposite player's teammates will cause the defending player to constantly swap between the two if they find the spot for it, which is very disorienting.

7637,1465610,"This game would be *almost* amazing if it weren't for the teammate switching mechanic. Switching teammates is proximity based so it'll switch to the more forward player on your team when you're close enough and what feels like prematurely since you're still holding left/right on the controls. So as a result, you switch to the forward teammate, who runs forward while you lose control of the teammate with the ball, so it's stolen by the opponent. In theory you could just pass the ball to the next teammate but sometime you gotta just slide the ball past the opponent blocker, and then you just lose it because you no longer have control of the right teammate. If teammate switching was smoother or more manual, game would be very cool. There's also no settings in game so you have to control sound via Windows, and there's not rebinding or fine-tuning any mechanics.",0,1683938155,17,0,8

Each team has their strengths and weaknesses based on four categories: Attack, Speed, Control, and Defense.

Controls are snappy and the pace is [i]insane[/i].  You’ll use lightning quick decisions to choose whether to slide, lob, or smash the ball into the opposing players.

You can't even practice with it in training mode since the only thing there is a list of moves and invincible targets that slowly move up and down, which make it about as useful as a controls list. If they just did that instead of a training mode I honestly believe we would never know the difference. Hard computers are fine but bad controls don't make a challenge.

Absolute hidden [b][u]GEM[/u][/b]! Gameplay's beautiful. The sheer anticipation of trying to score and having the goalie block it 10 times over is amazing. I can clearly see this becoming competition for SSB nights as the go to with how chaotic it is and it's potential high skill ceiling. Currently only supports local split screen which is a massive bummer as this [u]NEEDS[/u] to be played with as many friends as possible, although preferably not with remote play together as input delay would be tedious given how fast paced the game is. Also MAYBE the addition of more than one person per team like 2v2 or 3v3 would be nice. If it works, it'd be fun to play with 4+ players, but the game's clearly meant for 1v1 so I get not adding support. No settings?

Also an idea to spice up the campaign: have it be more about building your own team by leveling up and choosing stats vs AI that's has randomly generated specs around the same level. Probably extremely difficult to implement, but I think it would add a lot of singleplayer replayability [spoiler]and more reward for beating you know what[/spoiler].

Overall 9.5/10.


Pros:[list]
[*]Quick to pick up.
[*]Each team has a combination of different stats to suit your style (Attack, Speed, Control, Defense)
[*]Humorous announcers.
[*]Featherweight file size.
[*]Fun Campaign. Big spoiler, but  [spoiler]there [i]is[/i] more than just soccer[/spoiler].
[*]Quick to pick up controls.
[*][u]Very[/u] fair price.
[*]Infinite replayability with friends.
[*]Way too fun for it's own good. [/list]

Cons:[list]
[*]Sometimes the pause doesn't work.
[*]Team colors can get confusing. Away jerseys would be nice when colors are too similar.
[*]If you start the game with clicking, you need to restart to play with a controller.
[*]Lack of audio, controls and display settings
[*]No online support. Online would make this a best of it's genre.
[*]Player swapping is automatic, kinda wonky and can be jarring. It's not that bad and should be default, but I'd like to see an advanced control layout. On controller something like having cycle player left/right on the bumpers, move boost to RT and have swap formation be on LT or View (Back on the 360 controller) [/list]

The graphics are quite good, and although the movements of the characters are not fluid, they are above average for indie games. Also, every time you complete a mission you can upgrade: there are grenades, speed, rifles, flamethrowers... that can be bought with the coins you collect.

What do I mean? Crouching does not make sense, the HP seem to be infinite until they are not.

In the DLC this seems to be improved. Although I did not finish every single target and achieved all gold medals, yet, the challenge seems more fair and less tedious than in the base game. That results in a positive review and recommendation from my side.

Pros:
I only have used Mjolnir and Aegis so far, but from what I could tell they were fun. I plan to try some other stuff for my next play through. 
The bosses that I seen where pretty cool.
The upgrades for the weapons mostly looked unique, it depends on how many you get per playthrough, and if they alter the way you play at all. 
Audio and Voice acting was all good.

Seek Girl VII is the seventh in a series of 8 Seek games, at the time of writing this review. Developer DSGame currently has 15 games released on Steam. Important to know we are dealing with a more experienced developer, in this over-satured market of x-rated puzzlers, always some streamlined quality might be expected.

In this basic game, several different girls, have to be unlocked in order to achieve a perfect game. Player has to puzzle in a sokoban game, by slotting stone block pieces into place, a pathway has to be created in order to reach the girl. This is a rather fun and rewarding task, which is the whole gameplay experience of the game.

The artstyle of the pictures of the girls is good at best. Throughout the whole game, the same artstyle is kept the same, which is kind of a plus. In some games in this genre, this may not be the case and can be very annoying. Pictures are quite arty and colorfull. After installing the free x-rated patch, animated x-rated scenes, which have some basic option, become available as well. These scenes are quite good, better quality is available on the market, however. The girls themselves have a broad range in clothing styles and settings. All girls / scenes can be accessed through the main menu screen, for future reference.

39 achievements can be unlocked through this title, achievable in a few hours. Which makes Seek Girl VII excellently suited for achievement hunters and completionists. No grinding has to be done in order to unlock all of the achievements. All achievements can be unlocked in a single playthrough, given you research the levels well. In this seventh title, there are achievements implemented which require you to play optimally, this can be quite challenging in a sokoban type game, but there are great guides available on Steam’s community hub available. Levels cannot be rushed or skipped for faster completion in this installment, however. The addition of the werewolf chasing the player in this installment adds a lot of difficulty, compared to former versions of Seek Girl, the game can be considered quite challenging.

To conclude: I did enjoy this game quite a bit, gameplay is fun, repetitive, being overall challenging. Main reason for me to play this title, was because of the easy achievements and perfect game, however. Once completed, this is a game i will not come back to again. Solely consider picking this game up for its achievements and perfect game though, do not expect a lot of gameplay or great x-rated content.

Recommended for: casual players, hentai lovers, achievement hunters and completionists.

Cheers,

[b]END OF THE WORLD - NTR[/b] is a stealth game about collecting food to get into a waifu's pants.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Collect and cook food to earn lewds and new minigames. ""Energy"" is expended when ""exploring"", though it can be regained by food. You must dodge zombies and collect [i]trash bags,[/i] which contain Cheetos, leeks and steaks. To cook them, all that you have to do is time a single button press. In addition to gaining energy, cooking will also yield ""hearts"". Hearts are used to unlock a gallery and two new minigames. The first is a game of ""cups"", where you must track a diamond in a flurry in spinning cups. The second game is an extension of the gallery, but it's fully animated and [b]way more lewd. [/b]

[h1]Story[/h1]
It's the end of the world, and zombies have taken over! You escaped the pandemic, and you're one of two survivors holed-up in some concrete refuge. You share a space with an attractive woman, though she's not receptive to your. . . [i]sexual advances.[/i] Nevermind repopulating the world, she's mourns the lost of her boyfriend, Tong. You offer to find him, though little does she know you know the way to her heart: it doesn't take her long to forget Tong as you fill her tummy with trash-bag steaks and street-leeks!

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen is attractive and stylistic, but it looks [i]cheap[/i] -- could be the low-poly assets. There are no adjustable user-preferences (which is kind of [b]BS[/b]). The in-game visuals are unremarkable. If I'm not mistaken, I think I've seen a lot of the low-poly assets in other games, and they strike me as so, so [b]stock.[/b] The protagonist looks like she came from another dimension! It's too bad [i]her world[/i] didn't have the budget for HD textures.

[b]- The Goods-[/b]
There are five static CGs and one short movie to see from the ""Gallery"". Only a few of the CGs feature nudity, and the movie isn't one of them; but it's got clothed masturbation! Once you unlock the final minigame, you can choose from ten sexual animations (which focus on a handful of sex-positions). The animations aren't remarkable, but they'd be serviceable if it wasn't for the gross censorship. Normally, I try not to complain about censorship, but the mosaics in this particular game are [b]dreadful.[/b] Each animation is timed, and once time's up it's orgasm time! Unfortunately, there aren't any [i]sick[/i] money shots.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Wait for a strong sale or removal of mosaics. If it wasn't for the generous sexual content, I would have slammed this game with a [i]strongly worded[/i] review. [b]END OF THE WORLD - NTR[/b] could be an [i]okay[/i] game with a few gameplay refinements. If dodging zombies was more responsive and challenging, it'd make collecting snacky-snacks [b]way funner.[/b] If the lewd-content was better distributed, and not unlocked all-at-once it'd make for stronger lewd-experience. [b]END OF THE WORLD - NTR[/b] is not dissimilar in quality from what I expect from ""memeware"": there is [i]actual gameplay,[/i] and [i]actual hentai[/i] to watch!

Way too overpriced for the amount of value you get out of the game

20 hours-in thoughts below;

There's only like 4 enemy types pasted all over the place goblin, skeleton, zombie of which you see pasted all over the place, and then there are ghoul-like things for the final area that play near identical to skeletons.
there's bats too I guess? They are hardly an enemy though.

Through the near 20 hours I lost in this game, loot was not terribly great and I felt at a certain point, I and my friend I was playing with would have had to grind for hours on end to get even relatively close to the amount of damage the AI was dishing out.

Crafting was nearly useless and din't help the lack of quality loot either

Oh and the campfires! The main way to heal is to sit by these campfires in safe zones kinda like a souls-like game, however, you only heal like +2 hp per second. So you just have to sit there, and wait, and wait. I was running a high health unarmed build, and after the halfway point I started letting enemies kill me to reset my health because it was miles faster.

Honestly I wouldn't be so actively negative towards this game if the studio behind it:
1. Didn't try to defend the $55 price tag on this glorified tech-demo
2. Started to put out meaning full updates to change the major problems it has, not adding a single weapon type every 3 months

7754,1464320,"I've played a lot of open-world games, all with great control and gameplay. Games like GTA V, 7 Days To Die, No Man's Sky, Fallout 4, and a lot more. I am trying to figure out how they made this game, and yet they clearly have never played GTA V or any other similar game. The only thing that lets me to believe that they did play GTA V is you have to go to bed to save your game, just like in GTA V. For the record, I got this game on sale for 90% off, so it was $1.99. If you can get it on sale like I did, that's about the best price you can get.

[h1][b][u]CONTROLS[/u][/b][/h1]
What were they thinking? You have to use a controller to play this game, and yet certain situations allow you to use the keyboard. You can interact with items and objects with the keyboard, but walking, driving, and camera control are all done with a controller. Why? This is why I am curious if they have ever played GTA V, or any other similar game. Why did you make a PC game with little keyboard controls? When using a controller, the right analog controls the throttle and break while also controlling the camera direction, while the left analog controls the steering and camera angle. How the hell are you supposed to drive like that? The most common thing about any driving game is that the camera automatically follows the car. That does not happen in this game, you have to control the camera at the same you are driving. Why?

[h1][b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b][/h1]
Once you can get past the completely confusing controls, it's not a completely bad game. The game itself has a lot of potential. However, because the game was made in August of 2021, it doesn't show any signs of it being up dated anytime soon. If this game was still in early access, perhaps. The idea is it's a relaxing game of ""do whatever you want"". Buy clothes, homes, cars, and then walk around the island doing stuff, such as shooting crabs, chests, and anything else that can be shot at. You can buy cars ranging from a family car to a tank, monster truck, sports car, and a few more. You can also upgrade your car at the garage. (Caution, not all cars can be upgraded) Guns range from AK-47 in various colors to other various times of machine guns... in various colors. (There's really not that big of a selection, it just looks like there is) You also have to make sure you get the right ammo for the gun you purchase. (For the record, I couldn't figure out how to equip the gun, let alone use the guns... yet.) You can also purchase boats to travel on water to other smaller islands around the major big island. You can also purchase a few homes, but they all look the same inside. There's also a casino if you're feeling lucky and gain casino skills.

Now, along with this, there's a few other odd things that happen in this game. They designed the game so you can tan from being out in the sun. You can either purchase suntan oil to protect you from the sun, or you can get tanning oil to tan your skin. This is an interesting feature for a game.

The only big issue I have, outside the controls, is the stamina bar. At the lower left side of the screen you will see 3 bars. The strength bar, energy bar, and stamina bar. The first 2 are pretty straight forward and I can understand how it fits. The stamina bar I hate because you use it so quickly and takes forever to recover stamina in this game. You mostly use it up when you run.

[h1][b][u]OVERALL[/u][/b][/h1]
It's not a completely awful  game, but I am really confused as to why you made a PC game where you need analog controllers for this game instead of keyboard. Not saying there's anything wrong with that, but because it's a PC game, why not set the controls like in GTA V or 7 Days To Die. Follow other games example. I get you're trying to be different and unique, but there's nothing unique if the game itself is half broken or confusing. As mentioned, if you can get this game on sale for 90% off, get it, but even then you are better off spending your $2 on something else. Other wise, it's not worth the headache. I only reason I say ""NAY"" is because, although it has potential, it really needs to be polished and fixed... a lot. Whatever the programmers/devs were thinking, It's not the right way to make this game. Also, please fix the language, 50% of the game is not in english.",0,1679134126,97,0,73

7766,1464390,"While this is a relatively solid game with a really fascinating game mechanic and pretty stand-up music, it's challenge, story, and other mechanics are definitely lacking. When first playing, I immediately put the difficulty on hard, just because I like to challenge myself a bit more with games like these, however, instead  of an actual ""challenge,"" I found that the gameplay just becomes incredibly tedious- enemies taking up to ten shots to go down with the pistol, and boss battles that last WAY too long for it to keep my attention, especially the ""clown car"" of the Carnival Level. The story, while not as important for a game like this, starts out with something that can definitely be built upon, with the protagonist seemingly getting the curse from whoever the person is serving as the first boss, only for that story to go absolutely nowhere. The protagonist doesn't seem to have any real quest, other than, I guess, getting rid of the curse? But even at the end, there is still little to no indication of this being so in the lab. For other mechanics, I truly wish there was some sort of leveling-up system and hub world, because leveling up would lead to gameplay being far less tedious, and the hub world could lead to more quests, even revisiting some levels, by talking to NPCs like in the beginning of the game with the wizard(?) and even petting the dog. 
All in all, it's pretty solid, though I do not recommend playing on hard at all like I did, but at this point, it's just too bare bones to be worth more than 1 or 2 plays.

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
What excels at this game's visuals lies in its interface - the main menu, cutscene, and even the screen that happened after you finished each level looks neat with all the simplicity. The main menu looks clean with the white color while still making it look attractive with images and animation. Although the in-game models might look like porcelain dolls at first glance, the cutscene portraits look smooth and nice to look at with effects and lighting.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story is focused on a sci-fi setting where androids and brain transfers are a thing. Dialogues mostly revolve around you, the main character, that is looking for a log of a researcher to find out the background of the main plot. It was interesting to see the concept that the game has in mind of the topic, and if you are not interested in that, the story also has a bit of heartwarming element with the characters. The dialogues are flowing smoothly and are written in such a way that makes it easy to understand, even to those who didn't know about the topic. However, it can be hard to focus reading the text since the camera keeps on moving on cutscenes.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game is a fast-paced hack and slash where you need to kill all enemies on the level to continue. The thing is, your attack power will be increased by one for every enemy that you kill, which makes fighting easier as time goes. However, standing still for a long time without hitting an enemy will make you lose this damage increase, so you must keep on moving and slay the enemies on your way as fast as you can. Your score will be calculated at the end of the level and you will be ranked based on how fast you are clearing it. Each level doesn't take longer than 1 minute, save for the very last level.

Your hand-eye coordination will be tested in this game. Since your damage starts with 1, it's unwise to attack an enemy with 10+ HP when there is one with 4 HP on sight. This makes you prioritize which enemies to kill first, whether it's because of their low HP or annoying attack. You can also block or dash to defend yourself against enemies' attacks to make sure you don't get killed. Since you only have 1-3 HP, which depends on the difficulty that you select, you must be careful not to get hit too much.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2654239457 

It's hard to move your character around. The game also has platforming sections where you need to dash to avoid obstacles, whether it's a pit or lasers. However, since the game doesn't have a tile-based movement, it's hard to predict where your dash will end up, making it easy to die because of a foolish mistake. In fact, I still didn't know how to finish one of the sections in a level without getting hit because of this. Moreover, your dashes have a cooldown, so you must make sure that you have it ready before proceeding.

Skills help to give some leeway in finishing the level. Eight skills are available to purchase and upgrade, which can help you in finishing the levels. However, switching between them midway is almost impossible to do since the timer will keep on running when you do that. You can finish the levels by using one skill, but I can see how using more than one in some levels can help to finish it faster.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2654240500

[b]Mechanics[/b]
More mechanics will be introduced later on, making the game more interesting or annoying. I liked levels that require me to kill enemies in a certain order to continue, but the levels that require me to block an attack several times are kinda boring. There is one level where I had to sit still to parry an enemy's attack ~18 times before I can finish the level and another where I had to remember the platforms' position before I could move on. The thing is, you need to block right when the enemy is attacking to parry - you need to develop muscle memory for these levels.

Some tutorials are introduced too fast. All mechanics will be explained at the first few levels to let you know how the game works. However, some mechanics, namely the parry and breaking the enemies' defense while they are stunned, never matter until the last few stages. I didn't aware that those mechanics exist in the game and got stuck for a long time because of it.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2654240840

[b]Boss[/b]
Boss fights feel redundant. There are 5 boss fights in total that are accessible at the end of each stage. However, they can be defeated in the same way. It's also hard to know whenever they are attacking since their models are very small.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished the game in 6.4h. I played the game in ""normal"" difficulty at first before I switched to ""easy"" at around the second stage. There are 5 stages in total with ~20 levels and a boss fight each. The easier difficulty helps if you want to get all levels in A rank for achievement, especially since you get more HP and have to deal with slower enemies. The game is still challenging to beat even at the easiest difficulty because of the platforming sections and parry mechanic.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I have a love and hate relationship with [b]Ruvato: Original Complex[/b]. On one side, I liked the game concept, slashing everything in my way to gain higher damage. However, I loathe the platforming sections. All of them. It's easy to die because of a foolish mistake, whether you didn't time your dash properly or the moving platforms that don't come your way when you dashed to a certain spot. I was frustrated whenever I failed because of them, but strangely, I couldn't stop playing. There is always that thought that wants me to play one more level before stopping. However, since the game is only ~6h long, the original price might be too expensive for the playtime it offers, so I suggest buying the game on a sale instead, and that's if you don't mind stressing yourself over numerous deaths.

7779,1464500,"I always hate leaving negative reviews, but when I have to...
Was interested in the artwork of the game and some screenshots, so I gave it a try, but unfortunately, fairly good graphics cannot compensate for the... whatever passes for platforming and fighting.
As another reviewer's said, platforming is broken. I have to agree — moving around the map can be quite a hassle sometimes, especially when the length of your dash is unpredictable or you can suddenly run out of dashes when you didn't expect to. That's fine though, it's manageable with a bit of patience.
However, the extremely aggravating thing about the combat is that the character cannot move when she's attacking. It may sound retarded, but quite often I find myself 0.5m away from the enemy, slicing the air like a fool because I cannot get close like I could in myriads of other games. Sometimes the annoyingness of this almost drives me up the wall - so much for being a super-cyborg when you cannot move and attack at the same time, eh.
In addition, the levels feel extremely repetitive. The 1st chapter is about 20 levels long; they're all almost identical, as when a game introduces a new concept (moving platforms, breaking platforms, new enemies etc.), it is stretched across several levels with little variance. I see no problem with condensing these 20 levels into 5 that would be more packed more content - and more reason to stay.
Because the way things are now, there is no reason to do that for me.",0,1608909792,57,0,116

7786,1464550,"BUY THIS GAME

Amazing OST, fast gameplay. Looks like a PC Engine game without running like one. Very good visibility on the enemies and bullets. Normal mode is very well balanced and an easy 1cc for shmup novices, gradually increasing the difficulty. This game is great for teaching fundamentals of the genre.

Like shmup junkie said in his review, this is absolutely a classic STG. The emphasis is on shooting enemies rather than dodging (although obvious you have to do that too). Bullet hell games are great, but it is nice to see the other type of STG represented.

7788,1464550,"I played the caravan mode demo for about 5 hours and loved the fast pace action and deep scoring methods. Off the strength of this i bought the full game and i am not disappointed. The graphics have a wonderful 8bit aesthetic which provides a clean and clear view of the action which is a good thing as the game moves at a really fast pace. The weapons are varied and work well giving the player lots of options and scope for experimenting to find the best weapon for a given situation. 
If you are new to shooters you will find the normal difficulty setting a great place to start as the challenge is not too steep, i personally bumped the difficulty to hard which i found a tougher challenge albeit not too overwhelming. A lot of the challenge in the game comes from chaining, collecting gems and finding the secret bonuses, its absolutely an old school shooter at heart but has many scoring techniques found in newer games. The PC Engine style graphics and gameplay are superb which all come together brilliantly to create an addictive shooter with depth and style. The music is absolute class and is easily up there with any i have heard, a definite must buy for the game and soundtrack.

7794,1464550,"Raging Blasters is an homage to ye olden shmups of an era in which I'm not even sure I was alive yet or not.
It's also a great game. You can easily tell that this game is full of passion and love towards the genre the moment you boot it up.

The gameplay is very fast paced, exciting and keeps you on your toes even in seemingly ""slower"" sections.
The game's mechanics may seem simple at first glance, but you can get very tricky/stylish in subsequent runs if you plan head.
Mastering toggling between Forward and Wide shot and planning ahead for enemy formations can easily mean the difference between keeping your multiplier or not.
The subweapons are all useful in their own way and you can also plan ahead in subsequent runs to utilize them to their utmost. Some weapons handle enemy formations better than others, and some can also be utilized to kill bosses quicker.
If you like to race for score and leaderboard rankings, you'll definitely love this game.

The soundtrack is also a joy to listen to, not much else I can say there, it's very fitting both to the style of the game and to the speedy nature of the gameplay.

However, I also have a few minor gripes with the game.
Only being able to go up and down 25% for each volume slider is a bit strange, I assume it's to emulate previous games of the genre or old systems, but I think ultimately it's just a bit inconvenient for the player.

People who would only check out the game for a single arcade playthrough might find the price a bit too high for the amount of content they get. The arcade mode can be completed in roughly ~25-30 minutes and the replay value of the game comes from scoring higher and/or coop fun with friends. Just a heads up if you wouldn't be interested in those aspects.

Another small issue is that currently the button prompts and configuration only seem to support controllers. This is mostly a personal issue, but I very much prefer the keyboard even in games like this, so I'm hopeful that proper support for it will be added in the future.

One tiny last bit to mention is that there are certain bosses that will just make you wait for some time during their fight.
Initially I thought that it was cool that you have to be careful with your positioning and utilize the different shots to fire at the core of the boss, but they have a ton of health and with the added phase where they're basically invincible, some of the fights really dragged on. Not sure, maybe I just missed the proper approach to them.

Ultimately this is a really nice, well made game. It's very enjoyable even for newcomers to the genre and it also supports co-op, so you can just sit down with your friends/family and enjoy an exhilarating speedy ride of destruction.",1,1611532522,61,0,3
7795,1464550,"Love to play a actual, classic Shoot-em-up on Steam without seeing your enemies dump way too much bullets for you to dodge instead? Are you new to the genre and looking for a game to jump into said genre? Then this is right up your alley! The overall gameplay is frantic, yet very enjoyable to play with a learning curve just right for the beginners and those who want to decompress. The enemy placements and bullet spread in relation to your ship's guns and overall activity provides enough of a good challenge, no matter the difficulty, and you can change the speed of your ship in case you need to move quicker or don't accidentally run into enemy fire. I love how it also gives you some time to prepare before you resume the game from the pause screen. The graphics are fantastic in its arcade-y retro style and you can have the option to add scanlines as well (although there is no option for you to rotate the monitor to maximize the size, but it's still visible!). You also have a wonderful soundtrack to boot! Overall, this is a definite buy for the Shoot-em-up genre!

Exactly like it was before the kids and the divorce. See you on the leaderboards be-atches :-) Peace",1,1611328453,4919,0,63
7803,1464550,"Raging Blasters is one of the easier vertical scrolling shmups I've played.  But still offers some challenge and something I recommend to casual or novice shooter players.  Especially if they can play it co-op.

The game has two shooting options to start: a front focus shot and a weaker front with 'X' pattern diffused shot.  Each having their uses depending on the type and pattern of the enemies.  Though, I overly rely on the focused front shot.  Raging Blasters also gives the player to toggle through their ship's movement speed with a slow, medium and fast.  I don't know if I like this mechanic.  At least not as much as I did with AngerForce: Reloaded.  However, it's greatly preferred to those old 80s/90s shmups that doled out speed as a buffs where none was far too slow and collecting too many was much too fast.  The game also offers the usual array of secondary weapon upgrades: homing, wave, penetrating shot, circling, and slow moving Area of Effect shot.  I lean on homing shot which works well through most of the game with the exception of the very end boss.

RagingBlasters is not without its faults.  Once I have the secondary weapon power up I want, it can become difficult to avoid picking up another one.  The ship that drops them pretty much goes back-and-forth across the whole screen and the power up itself takes its sweet time to leave the play area.  Good with you want to grab any kind of weapon.  Bad if you got the one you want.  Additionally, this is a little nit-picky, but the homing missiles are pretty large and ship like in shape.  So, they can often conceal enemies or at least confuse the player enough to sometimes get hit.  I also found the enemy bullets to actually be too slow for me, and would sometime crash into them well after dodging them initially.  But that's more of a me thing.  The last critique I have is the boss fights are on the easier side save the last one which either requires the penetrating shot or going back and forth beating the timer more than worrying about being hit.  And this leaves a sour after taste to an otherwise fun, simple and straight forward shooter.",1,1682396670,190,0,150

7809,1464550,"A very fun, relatively simple shmup. As a newbie to the genre (currently working on my fourth 1cc), this is easy to recommend to fellow beginners. Of the games I've played, this game offers enough challenge to excite while being structured enough in how the enemies deploy to be understandable relatively quickly. As well, the main scoring mechanics--chaining kills and collecting crystals upon enemy death--are simple enough to where I felt like I understood how to min/max from the second or third play through. Combine that with relatively easy to reach extend scores and it's one of the rare shmups I've played where there is a survival payoff to score play that feels achievable, since it doesn't take that many points to get extends. 

I only have two complaints: 1) the weapon type power-ups are too plentiful--I often found myself dying trying to dodge them to avoid my weapon changing to something I don't want. After playing and learning more about the genre, this seems to be pretty typical of the Compile-type shmups (Aleste for example), so I definitely think it's intentional; it's just not an aspect that I particularly like. 

2) On normal, some of the bosses, especially the last boss's final form, can be a bit tedious if you don't have the right weapon. Not having the right weapon either requires you to repeat a very specific pattern (in the last boss), or requires you to do the same pattern over and over for a long time; either way, when this happens the fight becomes boring. This is only a problem because it's somewhat easy to accidentally getting the wrong power-up. Granted, it is your fault when this happens, but it'd be nice if the fights didn't feel quite as rigid. 

Overall, a big recommend, and I haven't even tried the caravan (score attack) mode. Definitely going to return to the hard and expert mode once I knock a few more 1ccs off my list.",1,1695259548,563,1,4

7811,1464550,"Good game inspired by retro shmups from compile. The game has a minimalist approach in terms of game design.  The bullets patterns are simple but fun. The graphics have a minimalist look that were made in MSPAINT. However in this case is not a bad thing. In fact, many shups could take a lesson from them as in practice they have a visual clarity . Bullets are big and clear, background is mostly black, enemyes are big, etc. For me they are perfect, specially i am in middle 40 and the vision is not the same. 
The music is the high point of the game. fantastic minimalist chiptune. there is online leadeboards, but no replays.
The difficulty is low. A shmup veteran should crank the difficulty to the max as normal and hard are easy to 1cc, but even expert might be easy for shmup expert. Being a caravan game the objective is to kill most quickly possible similiar waves of enemyes, therefore you won´t have many enemy types. There are many modes and remote play. In fact you can even play 2 ships at the same time with a controller (something unique that i never seem).
The switch edition has technical better graphics (not better) and probably will suit better some people. personally i prefer the pc graphics because of visual clarity.  The price tag is ok,  but slightly high considering the average price of shmup on steam and the production costs of the same and comparing to the switch version. you should wait for discount (less than 10 euros).As a game sometimes less is more, and that is the case.",1,1685459064,330,0,86

7836,1464550,"A true oldskool shooter with a godlike soundtrack. No bullet hell madness here, just speedy shooting action bliss.

The game is thoughtfully designed to put you right back into the action when you die, rather than punishing you for losing your powerups, and this makes it a brilliant starting point for beginners. And if you want a challenge, just crank up the difficulty or try maintaining a combo chain in the addictive caravan score chase mode. Just. One. More. Try.

7837,1464550,"RagingBlasters is a game that's very hard to put down, and when you do put it down, you'll be thinking about how you can beat your score next time you pick it back up. But YOU don't care about score you say.... That's what I thought too, but then I got involved in a caravan contest for this game, and now when I play RagingBlasters, I'm always trying to improve my score. 
 And I'm no shmup expert, I'm very much a beginner/novice of the genre, but the difficulty on normal is so forgiving that it doesn't take long to build the confidence to tackle the harder difficulties. Besides the awesome scoring mechanics and the accurately tailored difficulties, the graphics of the game, though muted and not as pretty as some other titles from Cave or Toaplan, suit the theme and style of the game beautifully as the game really exudes a 80's-90's  feel. But just because the game feels like a throwback doesn't mean the game is slow. Right from the start of stage 1, you'll be flying your ship at warp speed, decimating waves upon waves of enemies with 5 different weapon power ups, and if you are successful, you might even be lucky enough to survive the creative and very fun boss battles of all 8 stages, all this while rocking out to a fitting soundtrack that's worth listening too by itself! Oh yeah, there's even a co-op mode so you can take on the baddies with a friend or compete against others with the online leader boards in the caravan modes (very addicting)!

The Arcade Mode has a wonderful gameplay loop with fun bosses and tons of popcorn enemies to blast down. The caravan mode is a exhilarating challenge to obtain the highest score you can in 3 minutes with a lot of extra secrets to discover. 

One of my favorite non bullet hell shmups is Summer Carnival ‘92: Recca on the NES and Raging Blasters gives me the same amount of adrenaline and focus as Recca.

[b]Dark Side of Steam[/b]. If you've read my reviews of [b]Last Escape[/b], [b]Planet Station[/b], [b]Gold Dust[/b] and [b]PSIONIC[/b], you know about the [b]NL Studio[/b]. The dude who uses [b]Raycasting Game Maker[/b] (a basic freeware tool that lets you make your own simple [b]Wolfenstein 3D[/b] clones) to release three new levels every bloody month. Or even often. Because seriously, how long does it take to change some sprites and make three dumb levels that you can beat in just a few minutes? I'm not kidding. Even though I've never seen [b]Dark Side of War[/b] before, that's exactly how long it took me to finish it. Five... bloody... minutes.

Just a couple of enemy types, just a couple of weapons, no story (no even basic text at the beginning), no statistics (all you get here after you finish the level is a white screen that wants you to press the [b]Enter[/b] key to continue), no even keys (all you need to do here is to find an exit)... The [b]NL[/b] dude doesn't bother. Like... at all. About an hour in [b]RGM[/b] and here it is! Yet another scam for a buck. So... yeah. Here's another one of those nasty [b]RGM[/b] scams from [b]NL[/b]. This time in [b]Wolfenstein 3D[/b]-like setting. Because why bother? The dude already made crappy shovelware that looked like [b]Catacombs 3D[/b], he made one that used enemies from [b]Duke 3D[/b], so... yeah. Here's some [b]Wolf 3D[/b] for you. Because somebody needs easy money.

As usual, all I want to say is that you should seriously avoid commercial [b]RGM[/b] products. Never worth it. Especially since the tool is very limited and comes with a big amount of technical problems. One of which is a nasty mouse bug. You want to see what [b]Raycasting Game Maker[/b] can do? Go to [b]IndieDB[/b]. It has a lot of completely free examples that are [i]way[/i] better than this and at least come with a fair amount of levels. Sometimes even with some sort of basic story. But paying for such stuff? It's always a no. You can't make proper commercial game with [b]RGM[/b]. You... just... cant. And [b]NL Studio[/b] MOFO? It's not like anyone ever tried here. All that [b]NL[/b] needed is just enough content to make a couple of screenshots for the [b]Steam[/b] store page and then sell as many copies as possible before [b]Gaben[/b]'s anti-scam team will find out about all that.

Well, what can I say? Clearly, I can't even say “shame on you”. Because this kind of people? They don't have any conscience to appeal to. All they have is some basic greed. Selling something like this? It's pretty much the same thing with asking people for a couple of bucks on [b]Facebook[/b]. What I [i]can[/i] do, though, is to warn all of my friends. This “product”? It is [i]not[/i] a cute lil' [b]Wolf 3D[/b] clone. It's a shameless scam from a terrible person. Even for a couple of cents? You don't need this in your library. [i]Avoid![/i]",0,1610626808,9,0,526

I am currently playing some farming games and they are really relaxing - Exactly what I need in my spare time. Next to that I tried the beardless wizard. I knew the game concept from the Ipad of my kids, so I know that it is actually not such a hard game. 

Still I am having a good time with the game. I enjoy helping the people and gather stuff and try to figure out in what order I need to collect the ressources to finish the level. I also like the variety in levels, it's not like ""oh here is a new level, just build everything again like in the last level"" every level has a unique twist to it - And even if you beat the level there is an alternative version. 

The mechanics are really good imo, it kinda makes sense to me, you need to think ""should I upgrade the buildings or rather repair that bridge?""

Okay I mean I have only played for 1 hour yet but it was a lot of fun and I am looking forward to finish the game. I can imagine that some people can spend a long time with the game trying to optimise every level and get gold everywhere. MAYBE IT WILL BE ME? I mean I am not a completionist but I could imagine myself trying to get gold in the levels. And with my 36 years old I am slowly but steadily becoming a grandpa in terms of gaming. 

Okay whatever, the only gripe I have is that it has the same sound track in every level and even if its okay it gets annoying really fast.

7880,1463780,"A really good Ace Attorney style game in a Wuxia Setting. Both the Art and Music were a lot better than a game with this price would let you expect. The english translation was very readable as well, except for constant, wrong splitting up of words and some untranslated chinese symbols, that make solving a riddle in the last case harder than it should be.

I definitely recommend this hidden gem, but I do have some nitpicks:
First, even though game has a wuxia setting, it is a very ""grounded"" one. If you played the Demo, set in the enigmatic Order of the Blade, you might expect a lot of similiar cases, taking place in exotic martial arts sects or other typical Wuxia tropes. That is not the case. After the first introductory case, which barely counts, the rest of the 4 cases are following a common storyline, that deals with the murder of a highranking official, and the uncovering of a conspiracy. It ends up feeling very mundane compared to the Demo case. I was hoping for the wuxia elements to be more prominent.
Second, one of the features to distinguish it self from Ace Attorney is the ability to choose the outcome of a case. This was a decent idea, executed very badly. The mechanic first appears at the end of the introductory case, where your choice has very minor consequences. Then it disappears completly, as there is no way to influence the endings of case 2 or 3, and only appears again right at the end of case 4, the last case. [spoiler]Here you can basically decide between 2 endings. Both endings, though, are somewhat dissatisfying. After basically 5-8 hours of a linear experience I would have preferred just having a satisfying ending and I don't understand the point of this mechanic at all. [/spoiler]

Thats all my problems. All in all it is a very solid experience, especially for the price point.",1,1682613705,645,0,9
7881,1463780,"This is a really good detective game in the style of Phoenix Wright. More than Phoenix Wright, it makes great use of a very flavorful setting (Ming China/wuxia). It's generally a more serious set of cases than Phoenix Wright, and the characters are more enjoyable. (Fewer annoying comic relief characters). It's hard but usually fair/logical and you get unlimited retries. 

The first case is brilliant. The case takes fantastical plot twists in who killed whom and makes it feel entirely natural. Overall it's one of the best tutorial missions I've ever seen, and one of the best mystery cases I've seen in a video game. The main character's trainer solves this beautifully convoluted case almost instantly and there's a lot of writing skill in how he realizes the truth and how he nudges you towards little pieces of it. 

...

Case interaction: you can understand a Mohism case fully but still get some choices wrong if you try things in a different order than the writers intended. In one case I had to challenge a character who claims he brought ""nothing"" to a crime scene. I have evidence that he had a cape. I nervously offer the cape as a contradiction even though only an asshat detective would claim that having clothes contradicts anything, unless the crime scene were like a nudist colony or a Kevin Spacey birthday party. The game slaps me around for giving the wrong answer. Fair enough. Later on, I get asked to find ANOTHER contradiction and then the cape contradiction is suddenly a big deal. WTF. 

... 

If you haven't already played the game, it's really solid and I recommend it. 

If you have already played the game, the backstory sounds like it could be a con job. [spoiler] Reportedly a ~9 month pregnant royal VIP is rescued after a siege is broken and their first instinct is to move her? Their boat comes under heavy attack, and she sees this as an opportunity to murder a bodyguard and light the ship on fire? Then she jumps into the water and swims away, and then she *walks* to a friendly keep miles away, and she successfully gives birth to a healthy child that night? [/spoiler] Press X to doubt.

7882,1463780,"A good story set in a pretty and fairly rich world. It is 100% a detective, mystery-solving game, but of the linear style; you don't have freedom to go about the cases your way(e.g. choosing who to question), but rather gather evidence and do deductions and questioning in a specific order, gradually revealing more and more of the case. I found the translation pretty good; not especially stilted, and clear with all the necessary information gameplay-wise, but could be better. One annoyance was the text formatting: there's unnecessary hyphenation(as in, to break words across lines) and sometimes the hyphens are even misplaced so they're not the last thing on the line.",1,1683769715,218,0,7

7884,1463780,"I've had a very good time playing this game! It nails the wuxia vibes and the Ace Attorney-style gameplay works surprisingly well in this setting. The Chinese-to-English translation is good, with some puns and jokes thrown in (which seems like a staple of any Ace Attorney-style game). It's not perfect, but at no point was I unable to follow what was being talked about. The art style is unique but I grew to really like it! And the voice acting is nice.

The cross-examination is on a timer, but you get unlimited tries. So don't stress about the timer. Also, the game narrows down what pieces of evidence you can submit for the cross-examination which makes it easier to find relevant clues (but doesn't eliminate the challenge). 

One criticism I have of the game is that at certain points the game will ask you to make logical deductions where lots of concepts are floating on the screen and you have to click on the right ones. The concept is fine, but I think it must work better with Chinese characters because the sentences are hard to read in English because they wiggle around. Thankfully if you hold your mouse over them they pause. But I think that system could have been executed a little better.

The second criticism I have is that when you are browsing through cross-examination statements, the game will slowly reveal the text instead of having it all written out. That is fine for the initial dialogue, but it was a little annoying when finding statements to contradict. And it adds pressure to the timer. This is a very minor thing, and as I mentioned before, the timer doesn't matter because you get infinite retries.

其实整个剧情对于廖永忠和韩林儿在瓜步翻船的历史事件做了个很巧妙的改编，我个人对这点还是很喜欢的。但是谜题的设计又给我有种为了这碟醋来包饺子的感觉，先有谜题，再想剧情来套上去，就导致很多剧情走向很生硬，人物动机也不够充分——完全有比这种犯罪更简单直接的方式。还有第三章三个东瀛黑衣人的设定感觉就纯粹是为了看上去很cool，是毫无剧情意义的设定。而且谜题也挺多漏洞的：第二章那个水缸装雨水居然也能看不清深浅；第三章顾泉不仅一脚把地面踢裂，还能把剑踢了插入木柱子那么深，有点魔幻了；第四章在一个木制阁楼的地板试图通过洒水来搬重物也非常离谱，还有就是秦双双从水里钻出来拿了李乘风给的雨具和灯笼，可身上还是湿的呀，替换的公文又是怎么防水的，难不成是牛皮纸？
再就是结局，秦双双可是连自己的恩人之子顾泉都能杀的，最后居然两个结局都能善终，真的为顾大哥意难平。还有公布真相的结局师父就这么没了，然后主角居然也啥都不干就硬流浪。
总结下来就是因为先有了觉得很cool的谜题再来圆的剧情，导致剧情虽然在大方向上挺不错，但是细节走向和人设根本不能多想。一认真就会像差评的那几个兄弟感觉吃了屎一样。
不过总体来说作为一款游戏我玩着还算满意，希望制作组以后的作品能有所进步，先设计剧情再来设计谜题，再完善完善游戏机制（比如语音全覆盖，比如语音可跳过等）。
最后还是希望不要有秦双双这样的角色了，不要一副看上去是受害者很正面的角色，背地里做事毫无顾忌滥杀无辜，最后还能落得个好结局，原神散兵那种lowb双标小丑还能善终的实在不想再看到了。",1,1682710202,480,0,4

7890,1463780,"If you're a fan of the Ace Attorney games, then I would highly recommend giving this game a shot.

The cases here are akin to Ace Attorney where not everything is as simple as it seems, which kept my interests throughout the whole game with its twists and turns.

The gameplay is very similar to Ace Attorney, with you examining scenes and gathering evidence, then having a rebuttal with suspects and witnesses. 

Key Differences :
- There is no 'Press' mechanic for testimonies. What you hear is what you have to work with.
   This can be a plus or a down for some depending on your stance on pressing testimonies in other games.

- Presenting Evidence is easier in Normal difficulty. Instead of choosing from a hoard of evidence, the game chooses a few (1-4) evidence that could or could not be relevant to the testimony at hand. All you need to do is figure out which evidence is the right one and to present it on which statement.
[Note : I played the game on Normal, I'm unsure of how it is on 'Enjoy the Story' and 'Challenge' difficulty]

I don't understand Chinese too well, so I played the game in English. The translation is pretty good, but there are some word breaking ( exa- *next line* -mple) that makes reading a bit tedious. I can't really say anything
about the voice acting since I don't understand them, but I do enjoy them! The voices fit the characters.

Overall, I really enjoyed the game! As a fan of Ace Attorney games, this game hit a lot of right spots with the
story, characters, and mysteries.

This is a super cute, slightly challenging platformer that keeps things simple and neat.  Really fun for a good 20 minute or so run.  That's all it is though.  You can blow through this game, have a simple time jumping through some obstacles, and enjoy.

Has some small I wanna be the guy and The End is Nigh vibes.  Again, silly and fun.

7924,1463870,"It is a shame that this game has so many technical problems because it really is very stylish. I love the macabre artwork and atmosphere, and the jumping feels tight and responsive. Unfortunately it is brought down by a lot of small annoyances: The default keybinds are bad and cannot be remapped, there is no key for quick restart upon death (you have to use the mouse to click 'restart' every single time), it cannot be played full screen, and it frequently crashes to desktop (fortunately this is not a huge problem since it continues from the last checkpoint when you restart the game). The game is also very short, and most players will complete it in under an hour (my playtime reflects the fact that I played it through twice).

In summary, I do recommend it but only at a deeply discounted price (I paid around 50 cents for it). As it stands it is not really a complete and polished game, more like a demonstration of the developers' potential.

This is for more casual, not super hard fun.  The pieces feel soft, but they don't stick together.  They only stick on the board where the image goes.  Also, this game lags for me... Somewhat... But not a deal breaker.

There is a story and you can read it in both English and Russian.  I did it in Russian and I still could understand everything, so good work.  When you get enough girls towards the end?  The puzzles change to a different one.  I wont tell you what it is, but you can probably guess it.  :>

Alright about the ""hot scenes""... the girls are in suggestive positions... but they never become nude.  In fact, mine were fully clothed all of the time... Then I looked at the ""screenshots"" and found that other people had even less clothing to work with!  I don't know how they did it... But it would be nice to figure it out sometime.  Not that I am interested in girls like that, but beauty of the human body should be appreciated as well.  Especially in those moments.

Overall... Kept me entertained and sure, I'll play it again sometime.  (I don't know why I got the achievement ""Dead"" when I won the entire game, but alright... No one died... I don't think so....)  Apart from that, thank you for the short, fun casual puzzle game!!! :) =) :>",1,1617575828,136,0,935

There's plenty of free levels to see if you like this game and if you do, then you can get more levels by buying the DLCs, which don't cost much. The DLCs have regularly introduced new tile mechanics into the game so it keeps evolving as they bring more content in, so that's pretty nice.

Unlike Hexcells, this game lets you make mistakes and with me coming from those games it kind of bothered me but later ToastieLabs added features like Hardcore mode in the settings which allow you to have the game reset the level every time you make a mistake so i enabled that rightaway after it got added. :D It's also possible to disable the highlight effects of the special mechanic tiles if you want to map out their ""clues"" by yourself in your head. :P When i tried it first, i wasn't initially sure if i liked it but i quickly got used to the extra work and have kept it like this ever since.

I really like how the game builds on concepts that are learned. This makes it a lot less intimidating to learn a new math skill. The game also has a fun story with an important message about why knowledge and learning matter. The schoolhouse and computer lab in town are also very helpful too.
  The game contains many different locations to explore with many different ways to test math skills.  The better you do, the more character you meet who offer to join your party. The levels are also well-designed and some even contain different paths leading to bonus items. Fun game and activities that consist of entering the door that has the correct answer to a math problem, true / false questions from people they meet along the way, and a treasure hunt that contains many helpful items they can use to defeat the guardian of a level.

As you may have gathered from the description, the challenges in this game aren't the kind where you beat each challenge once and immediately forget about it. Expect to go through each obstacle enough times that by the time you complete it for the last time you have a 70-90% success rate getting through it.

7978,1464000,"I think Snowbill put it best with that memorable quote:
""Agony.""
I could not agree more.
10/10, would hurt myself again.

EDIT: In hindsight, I don't want ""Haha, funny meme"" to be the only thing I have to say about this game, and just making a joke because I too know of the creators other pieces of art seems unfair, both to him and the game itself.

""Ascent"" is an incredibly difficult, incredibly rewarding platformer with the goal to roll an adorable little snowball up a very strange mountain. If you ever wondered what Sisyphus would've felt like, this is the game for you, because it will demand an otherworldy amount of patience of you.

The platforming itself is actually incredibly simple. After all, snowballs can't do very much. The challenge arises not in the amount of systems you have to govern or a vast amount of enemies thrown your way. The challenge is simply ""Press Left or Right at the correct time"". And it does this wonderfully. It's as if the game is begging you to try again, no matter how unfair it might seem, how impossible a certain section might appear to you. After all, chances are, after failing a jump once, you probably know what to do. Executing on that knowledge is a whole other thing. But once you do manage to execute it, it feels incredibly rewarding... only for you to have to do it all over again, cause you failed the next jump. But you did it once already, surely you can do it again? By the time you beat the game for the first time, if you manage to do so, you probably won't have much trouble doing it again. After all, it will have been ingrained in your very core how long to accelerate at Part A, how many milliseconds to wait at Part C, and where exactly to stand at Part G-2.

The visuals aren't much to talk about. They're certainly not the greatest pixel art you'll ever seen, but that's not what anyone is here for anyway. They're fine. They do their job. They communicate ""This is a snowball, this is a piece of ice, this platform is moving"".
The backgrounds and weather effects are lovely though. Very charming.

The music is absolutely amazing. It doesn't distract you from the tense gameplay, but will get you bobbing your head to it and get you to not smash the nearest piece of furniture when you fall off an edge. Absolutely fantastic, 10/10, will listen to it regularly.

Overall, a lovely experience for the Ultimate Hardcore Gamer™. It will test your patience and sanity. If you have anger problems, stay away though.

FR tho, when i heard timotainment was making a game, i was excited. from the looks of it was the average Rage game, to the likes of Getting Over It With Bennet Foddy or Jump King, but it was much more. It has a puzzle element to it, that forces you to figure out a plan of action. The game is crafted well and takes skill to traverse as well as muscle memory. Overall the gameplay is really fun but i have some issues. In this game you play as Snowbill, who takes the role of Bennet Foddy in Getting Over It With Bennet Foddy or the Old man in Jump King, but his dialog is a little too self aware for my liking, and his dialog is boring and bare bones, giving such ""useful"" comments as ""i felt that"" in comparison to Bennet Foddy's inspirational quotes in his namesake game.

8009,1464000,"I like ascent, here's why

Summary: In ascent, the game made by the surreal video guy Timotainment published by Fireapples also made by Timotainment. The music is good, and Timotainment also made this. To cut it short, Timotainment made this game 100%. It’s a rage game much like Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy, but way more chill. 

	Mechanics: The main gimmick of the game is based on the fact that you can only move left or right. There are no checkpoints, but as you play the game more, the checkpoints are essentially how good you can recover from a fall. In each area, a new gimmick is introduced. The first area, snow, is all static and is basically a tutorial. The second area, construction, adds moving objects. The third area, ice, adds sliding physics, etc etc etc. This puts a cool spin on the game and keeps you entertained as you play. 

 My Opinions: I love this game. The game itself is super satisfying with the right mindset. If you don’t treat it like a rage game, it’s a really enjoyable experience. Very laid back if you don’t take it too seriously. The game’s backed by real bops of songs minus the first tutorial area which is just chill. Is it worth $5.00? I’d say so yeah. If you like the game, it’ll give hours of entertainment. It has some cool achievements too, some which are stupid and I’ll probably work for in the future. The game’s $4.00 as of right now due to it being the first week of release, but that ends soon. Get it on steam if you are epic.",1,1606434246,1413,0,10

Remember those 2016/2017 stand-still VR 180 wave shooters? This is one of them, but poorly made and made 3 years too late. You can ""switch weapons"" by using your joystick (touchpad if vive) to switch to the limited ammo special weapons. Wave after wave of the same baddie (each level has one different baddie) come from 3-5 different areas. You have to ""dual wield"". Point your hands down to do a quick reload on the unlilmited ammo weapon or just pull trigger until you run out of ammo on the special weapons.

There are 5 levels. Two different modes (barricade & survival) where the difference is that one is endless and the other is not. The endless mode will keep going until you die or your fame rate drops to 1. Keep pressing trigger! 

I do enjoy wave shooters. There are some really good ones from 2016-17. This is not one of them.

[b]Ghost[/b] is probably the weakest of the moments from this DLC. It's primarily just investigating a mysterious sound, and you either get to spend the moment with your moms or with Cove wandering around at night. That said, the nighttime backgrounds are pretty nice.

[b]Barbecue[/b] is great, and absolutely hits that perfect summer vibe.

[b]Runaway[/b] is my favorite of the steps, because it's a great culmination of Cove's characterization at this point, mixed with that childhood naïveté.

[b]Summerwork[/b] is okay. Not much to say here, it's a good follow-up to the Step 1 Expansion Moment, Library.

[b]Escapade[/b] is a super fun exploration into Kyra's character, and you get to explore further the dynamic between Cove and Kyra.

This isn't the most exciting Moment, but it's absolutely integral to Cove's personality. Each Step Expansion has its own Moment that specifically dives into Cove's personality, and this is that Moment for this Step.

I really like [b]Late Shift[/b]. As someone who's worked quite a few of these myself, I really liked the idea of a partner coming to make the shift a little easier. I really like the night-feeling vibe of shopping and doing things when everything else is closing for the night.

[b]Serendipity[/b] is a cute event, and it lets you go back and deal with people from prior moments that you've potentially had negative interactions with. If you've played XOXO Droplets, you'll definitely get a lot out of this moment.

[b]Boating[/b] is a really fun hang-out event. Lee is one of my favorite characters and she really shines in this Moment. There is a certain option where you get more out of this event by going one route than another.

I don't think a prerelease full review will do this game any justice. I will say the game play is a challenge, you have to figure stuff out on your own sometimes which as a masochistic gamer I really enjoyed. I think the enemies did a lot of damage even when I didn't expect it. The art style of this game is really cool! The story is linear but still has that multiple ending style. If you wanted some games to compare it to, Darkwood, and the Final station. I kind of wish it was longer and there was more characters to interact with to help with world building.

M&K were playable, though some buttons would periodically stop responding and I had to reboot the game. The character handles terribly, but after a while you can kinda work out how to do it and learn to mostly just run away from enemies. Entire levels can be completed very quickly by just ignoring everything. Even basic jumping is a mess. You know the long jump where you need to time it to hit jump right at the ledge to make it? Here you'll run into jumps where you need to jump early, or the hand grip won't trigger on the other side. Took a while to work out what I'm doing wrong. Overall, while you can get pretty decent and playing this, it still feels very random and overall unplesant.The story is pretty meh. I din't complete it, but I got most of the way there before I hit a dead end I can't work out. All paths are locked and I keep getting stuck in geometry or escaping the map.

8137,1464120,"More than any other, I think the word ""odd"" describes 600Seconds the best. More compelling than the sum of its parts, 600Seconds combines exploration with a fairly short and straightforward third person shooter adventure through a church. Exploring the empty church in the waking world for items for ten minutes before your siege in the nightmare seemed, at first, an unnecessary and kind of obnoxious feature (ten minutes is a long time!) though it does help set a certain kind of mood, but after dying in the nightmare once or twice the interest was made more clear to me.

The church at first appears impossibly weird and confusing, maybe even randomly generated, but both the items and the layout are the same every time. This is important because as you progress through the nightmare, which forces you onto a (mostly) linear path, you become more familiar with the various rooms, which then increases the interest of the initial exploration section, which feeds further attempts at the action section because of better/more gear and so on. It's really a pretty clever model and there's a lot of stuff to uncover, so much so that the 600 seconds went from feeling too long to too short, as I was always looking forward to the next attempt at exploring for the Shining weapons or other hidden stuff.

Unfortunately the action side does not fully hold up its end of the bargain. It controls and handles quite well, despite feeling a bit odd at first, and shooting is fun. All of the weapons feel powerful and are enjoyable to use. Aiming feels weird at first but you eventually get a good feel for where shots will go, and the distance at which you can trust your laser sight. There's a lack of enemy variety, but the various scenarios created by enemy/obstacle/room combinations give it a pretty good variety I feel nonetheless. The biggest flaw I think is that it's just simply not very hard. This in and of itself isn't a bad thing, but the game features no difficulty options whatsoever, and since the basic difficulty is fairly gentle, this means there's never a place to put your superior scavenging skills you'll develop over time to use. An unlockable hard mode with a more difficult enemy arrangement for the church, maybe with greater enemy aggression, would be a really excellent addition.

As far as bugs go I've experienced a few of varying severity. If you melee attack towards a climbable vine you'll grab it from far away and can then climb up and down not attached to anything and climb below the world and drown. I had an unfortunate death to this, though you can rectify it by climbing up til you reach the ""top"" and then fall normally. After the credits my game seems to softlock, leaving me no option but to close the game, which I'm not sure is a bug or not but is pretty weird nonetheless. Performance is pretty bad as well, my PC is far in excess of what I'd expect to be necessary for this game and my FPS is all over the place, and the total lack of ANY graphic settings whatsoever doesn't help. There was a patch just today that seems to have improved performance a solid amount however.

I really enjoyed my time with this game and despite the few issues really just want more. It has a unique mood due to it's protagonist and Cthulu influences alongside the total lack of music and just how the whole game kinda looks, it has solid action, and it has a lot of hidden stuff. It's not perfect, but none of the issues I have with the game are severe enough for me to do anything but recommend it if you can stand a little jank and a lot of weirdness.",1,1609669203,695,0,2
8138,1464120,"First and foremost, I think it's best to remember that this is StudioGekko's first title. So know going in that it's not very complex, not very long, and may be prone to jankyness. All that in mind, I still had plenty of fun with the game.
Item placements are not random, so learning the layout of the church and location of everything was really fun. I like that there's no text or story to read and that I can just make my own assumptions about what's happening, though maybe a little more to see would've been nice. After my first couple of unsuccessful runs, I thought I was done with the game but I found myself coming back to it the next few days to learn more and give it another shot.
Combat is unfortunately a tad easy, so after a few deaths to simply learn about enemy attacks/patterns you should have no problem beating it fairly quickly. I've gotten ~20min victory in that would've been shorter if it was possible to end the exploration phase earlier. Unfortunately I've never actually seen the final cutscene due to a consistent crash at the end, but I can tell from the achievement stats that others aren't having the same problem. The devs are still updating the game and have even fixed a minor issue that I pointed out to them, so I'll just wait for another patch somewhere down the line.

I will never understand. Anyway, this game is divided into three acts with the first act clearly being better than the remaining two. In the first act, you must hide from a deranged female with no way to defend yourself. You also hide from an enemy in the second act with no way to defend yourself, but the second act takes place in a dilapidated prison that I found not scary at all. The female enemy in the first act constantly bugs out to where she gets stuck turning in the hallway. In the second act, there is an extremely high pitched ringing sound that mimics tinnitus that I found incredibly annoying. Another bothersome aspect of this game is the forced headbob sway that caused me a great deal of nausea. Mouse sensitivity is also too high even on the lowest setting. Graphics are also faded and colorless. All three acts are so different that it really seems strange tying them in together in the same game. The prison level ruined this game for me because I found it more tediously annoying than scary. And the third act just ruined the game even more because it's basically one short area where you interact with a few puzzle items and are then shown some disturbing images of the main character murdering his own daughter with a gun and then shooting himself in the head.

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/VcGSA5itvVY

I do recommend this game, but it's definitely not for everyone. This is a rather nice title that will only appeal to those gamers who aren't dissuaded by a slow-paced game that requires patience & also some problem-solving. This game does have a tutorial, but it's a rather generic one that doesn't teach you all the game mechanics involved in the game.

Once you get into some of the hard difficulty jobs, you will be scratching your head to try to figure out how to do what the game wants you to do. It's just not explained clear enough. I found that to be the most frustrating part about the experience. There were also some bugs, but it wasn't as bad as the negative reviews mention (at least not for me). I did have some issues with the menu, but simply being persistent, I was able to get it to work (getting out of the menu laser and trying it again). I did experience one serious bug where I couldn't climb a ladder (needed to repair tank) or interact with the menu at all, simply moving to the yard and going back to the workshop area solved my issue.

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting mostly 90 fps, however, I also experienced some pretty severe frame rate drops at times. I had to lower graphical settings to good, but even then I would have occasional fps drop into the 50s. You do have full locomotion or teleportation available, along with smooth or snap turning. You can play game seated or standing. I did not have any problems reaching stuff, although occasionally I had problems with my tools getting stuck on objects as I walked by cramped areas.

Overall, I did have fun playing this game. It is fun once you repair the tank and then take it out for a spin & see your handy work in action. However, it's not always fun fixing the darn thing. It can be very tedious at times. So again, this game isn't for everyone. I think it was easily worth the $14 USD I paid (since I owned previous Play Way titles I got a further discount).

I can only laud the developers swift action in solving the aforementioned bugs. The problems have been largely fixed, and I can now warmly recommend this game.

Will change this review to positive as the situation develops: read on.

This is a VR version of Tank Mechanic Simulator; if you have played the original, you'll feel right at home. The tanks are the same, and the main difference (so far) is that the tank finding mechanic is automatic and done off screen (you can't dig out the tanks. Everything else seems to be in place, including the paint room and the museum.

The price is also good for the experience offered. Or it would be, if not for one major problem.

THE BUGS.

The menu system in the game is completely bugged. After a while playing, the menu tablet can no longer properly track your finger, which renders the game nearly impossible to play. THIS KILLS THE GAME.

You can see the developers did a proper job porting this game to VR. Tool use is fine, and the only problem I ran into (besided the menus) was finicky placement of some parts, especially the wires.

Devs, please fix this menu bug as soon as possible. I enjoyed playing, at least when the menus work properly. But said bug is a recurring, endemic issue and absolutely destroys the experience.

That said, I am confident that the issue will be resolved, and plan to go back to it as soon as it is. But until then, I can't in good conscience recommend this game.",1,1662073368,844,0,20

I know the developer will read this so ill just say it straight out lay it out on the table.

I was EXCITED as hell for this game when it hit prologu, I spent hours taking apart, rebuilding, cutting away, and so much more on a single tank excited for the full release...to be so..disappointing.
Im sure there are reason's behind it, but this game is so bare bones, I wouldn't even pay 10 bucks for this game, you get the basic tools, a few vehicles and that's it. you can't really drive them around, you can't sell them, or do anything else. its just build, look, repeat. 
there's no real ""repeating"" part to this game like some other sims have out there, its honestly a play maybe once or a few times when you're bored and never really pick it up again..they havn't had an update in the game since 2022 except an ""art contest"" they continue to feed the forums with ""we're listening to feedback and suggestions, and we'll aleart you in the appropiate channels when something happens, hope you enjoy the current version of the game! *insert average robotic reply here*"" which to me reads ""were not gonna be updating the game or releasing any more patches to fix the current bugs, and pretend its a complete game!"" while also still having deals, and sales constantly on this game.
the music is repetitive as hell, there's no option to change it, so you'll just have to completely turn it off, working in silence or popping your own music on, the workshop itself is...""cool"" at best, but that's it, its just ""looks"" there's not much else you can really do, you can't customize it, you can't change how it looks, how the lay out of the workshop is, nothing..you get the tools on the table, you get two spots for placing/picking up items you either buy or sell and that's it. all the other nifty things in the workshop are all static props you can't really do anything with...so environmentally..very very boring. 
but refuse to update it or fix anything, even the flatscreen version is far more fun this this lonely thing. 
its honestly really disappointing, you could be driving tanks, shooting targets, making sales, so many wonderful idea's the community has tried bringing forward to the development team just for them to ignore it completely or give your basic and generic developer response. 
-
I can't really recommend the game in this state, as I picked it up, played it once after I bought it and havn't touched it since. its basic, its bare bones, and..honestly not fun. sorry developers maybe if you'd give the game some more love, updates and actually give feedback instead of your generic robotic responses...MAYBE ill change my review and give the game another chance..but until I see an update that fixes or adds stuff that's equal to the flat screen and were not just ""basic"" and bare bones. im keeping it as a fat NO to the community looking for it.",0,1694043680,24,0,49

The driving is due for upgrades, there's no ability to peek out of the hatch or anything like that yet.
Not to mention that the controls for driving are just wacky. I wish you actually needed to use the actual control systems of the tank you were in.

I'd suggest taking inspiration from the game Steel Crew to get that to work.

8202,1463010,"I would really love playing this game in VR, but the sensitivity for grip on Index and the physical hands colliding with everything are my two biggest gripes. 

I have tried adjusting the grip sensitivity in steam controls, but tools and parts seem to randomly fall out of my hands in the middle of using them or moving my hands. It feels like the game says to drop the tool immediately if the grip readout is not at 100 and a single millisecond of it dropping below that reading will cause the held object in my hand to drop. This is really prevalent when I go to pull the trigger on the Index Knuckles.

The second issue is the physical hands that are really annoying, they make it hard to pick up tools and parts from the ground as a slight brush of my hands will send them flying. This also makes it a pain to pick up tools like the angle grinder because if it falls on its top, you need to do a weird push and scoop motion to get the game to detect a grab point.

Minor Inconveniences found: It is strange for the graphics preset setting and the actual graphics menu to be in two separate menus. The weird gripping angles for parts, where I go to pick up a part that's facing forward, and then when I pick it up, it snaps to a weird angle that makes it particularly annoying to place onto the tank. 

I want to enjoy the game, but these minor issues make it feel disjointed and weird to play on the Index.",1,1677982256,49,0,17
8203,1463010,"I like this game. If you like tank and the thought of working on them I can recommend it. 

However. I can not recommend this game as a casual relax and just do something game for the following reasons.

There are a few thing that could be improved upon.
While the hand physiks may have been a good though, I find myself annoyed my them. Especially when youve removed a part and want to put it somewhere it gets a bit akward feeling at times.
The parts are something that bothers me too. Once they have been removed you have to pick them up with your hands wich can be problematic if your setup is small because you can only get so close with the teleport and the movement and once youve move inside the tank you have the problem with the hand physik again. I'd suggest making a mechanik similar to that in Half Life Alyx where you can pull objects towards you (idealy tank parts and tools).
Lastly, while the crouch function is alright it still feels weird. I'd like to see some sort of hoist or lift wich pulls the tank up and allows oyu to use the space underneath it. Since this game programming wise very close to it's non-vr counterpart I doubt this would effect gameplay a lot.",1,1674149668,9,0,4
8204,1463010,"Most of the time it runs extremly well and without any bugs, even when bugs do occur they are most of the time not game breaking but just a slight inconvenience, Even when you get a game breaking bug the developers in the discord servers respond pretty quick and are very nice and willing to help.

Its a very calming game although i cant play for long due to my VR headsets weight.

One thing id like to see in the future for this game is tanks from ""smaller"" countries, for example Czechoslovakia or Sweden.

To sum this up, fun and relaxing game, I'd say its worth buying.",1,1673633060,736,0,2
8205,1463010,"As much as I love this game on the desktop version I can not recommend the vr version at this time. the tutorial is a bit jumbled in which it is not a guided tutorial but more of a jumbled check list on what to do. the game claims to have spots to carry tools but every time I tried to put a tool on me for later the boxes do not show up at all to store tools on your person. The game is also a little janky as well in the sense of if you pick up a tow rope you have a 50% chance of being launched into a corner or object; then there is also the tool handling which your tool will get stuck on a lot of parts and if your hand gets stuck then your tool will automatically drop out of your hand and you have to lean down to pick it up again. then there is also putting the tank back together which is another really annoying part since you have to go over to storage and pick up the part you need and place it back in the correct spot and you have to do this over and over again. Finally there is something about to wristwatch that is very confusing in the sense of the game tells you you should be able to look at emails that way but nope you have to go back to the table each and every time to look at emails or complete orders. Again I love the desktop version and I think the vr version has so much potential! it just needs more time love and care from the developers

Edit: So after giving this game a second chance and doing more looking into the controls the game is very much good! So I will say the game is very much worth it; the devs have indeed been working hard on the game and im still learning how to do some things that I have not discovered yet.",1,1672100293,639,0,24

Thanks to the tutorial they added the game was much easier although some things where confusing, like how to install things that are way too high up but i figured that one out.

The bugs. Yes there are bugs, i only encountered one. assembly mode auto disables when you install things by hand and not the laser which is annoying, don`t know if this is a bug but its annoying that the red square doesnt despawn when your trying to enter the tank to remove rust which was frustrating and annoying for me. Was a little dissapointed that steering the tank is`nt  done by the steeringhandles but that was ok. Overall this game is good for a new realese and the devs really cared about this port.

8221,1463040,"It's a real nice candy crush game with a narrated story and dragon theme :3

There is surely much more story-wise than I've expected in such a game, so we get 2 small cutscenes, self contained story about a girl and her dragon friend and all is delivered piece by piece every few levels of candy crushing of mixed difficulty.
Hard to say much about the gameplay as if you played any candy crush or ""match-3"" you already know what this is. I just want to say that's a real nice feel to have a full single player experience without typical to mobile counterparts ads, locking behind lives telling you how much you can play or steps to make before you auto lose a level and of course having to hold back with power ups because you get so little...
Nope, none of that here. You can buy upgrades but for playing and they unlock forever, you just charge them up with matching the blocks :3

1. I got a few random crashes, but the only persistent crash was after dying and pressing the ""Retry"" button. 
2. Another thing that i have noticed is that the ""Triangular Foundation"" and the ""Wooden Wall"" are reversed in the menu. So if you craft a triangular foundation  when you try to place it on the ground is actually a wall.
3. I did also noticed that the enemies you take out, they respawn from the place that you killed them.

But i think this can be a easy fix, i would like to see bigger times in between the respawn time, not only on the crates(loot) but also on the enemies.

I think this is a good game, and with some work has a great potential.
